<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>Four Alberta ranches are the scene of this story. Of these, three
were quarter sections of land in Yankee Valley, and the fourth the
vast Bar Q, whose two hundred thousand rich acres of grain, hay and
grazing lands stretched from the prairie into the foothills of the
Rocky Mountains, where it spread over the finest pastures and the
"Chinook"-swept south slopes, where the cattle grazed all winter long
as in summer-time, its jealous fingers, like those of a miser who
begrudges a pinch of his gold, reaching across into the Indian Reserve.</p>

<p>For many years the Bar Q cattle had had the right of way over the
Indian lands, the agents who came and went having found it more
profitable to work in the interests of the cowman than in those of
mere Indians. As everywhere else in the country thereabouts, including
the Indians themselves, the agents soon came under the power, and were
swept into the colossal "game," of the owner of the Bar Q, the man
known throughout the country as the "Bull."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Few could recall when first the Bull, or to give him his proper name,
Bill Langdon, had come into the foothills. His brand had blazed out
bold and huge when the railroads were pushing their noses into the new
land before the trails were marked. Even at that early period, his
covetous eye had marked the Indian cattle, "rolling fat" in the term of
the cattle world, and smugly grazing over the rich pasture lands, with
the "I. D." (Indian Department) brand upon their right ribs, warning
"rustlers" from east, west, south, and north, that the beasts were the
property of the Canadian Government.</p>

<p>Little Bull Langdon cared for the Canadian Government and he spat
contemptuously at the name. Bull had come in great haste out of
Montana, and although he had flouted the laws of his native land, away
from it he chose to regard with supreme contempt all other portions of
the earth that were not included in the great Union across the line.</p>

<p>His first cattle were "rustled" from the unbranded Indian calves which
renegade members of the tribe had driven to convenient forest corrals
and traded them to the cowman for the drink they craved. Though the
rustling of Indian cattle proved remunerative and easy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> Langdon by no
means overlooked or despised the cattle of the early pioneers, nor the
fancy fat stock imported into the country by the English "remittance
men."</p>

<p>Slowly the Bar Q herd grew in size and quality, and as it increased,
Bull Langdon acquired life-long leases upon thousands of acres of
Government land&mdash;Forest and Indian Reserve. Closing in upon discouraged
and impoverished homesteaders and pioneers he bought what he could not
steal.</p>

<p>Somewhere, somehow, the Bull had come upon a phrase of the early days
that appealed vastly to his greedy and vain imagination.</p>

<p>"The cattle on a thousand hills are mine!" he gloated, and roared aloud
another favorite boast:</p>

<p>"There ain't no cattle on two or four legs that Bull Langdon fears."</p>

<p>He was a man of gigantic stature, with a coarse, brutal face, and in
his expression there was something of the primitive savage.</p>

<p>The name "Bull" had been given him because of his bellowing twice,
his great strength and his driving methods with men and cattle.
Tyrannical, unprincipled and cruel, Bull was hated and feared. He had
fought his way to the top by the sheer force of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> raging, dominating
personality, and once there he reigned in arrogance without mercy or
scruple.</p>

<p>To him cattle and men were much alike. Most men, he asserted, were
"scrub" stock, and would come tamely and submissively before the
branding iron. Very few were spirited and thoroughbred, and for these
the Squeezegate had been invented, in which all who were not "broke,"
emerged crippled or were killed. Finally there were the mavericks, wild
stuff, that escaping the lariat of the cowpuncher, roamed the range
unbranded, and for these outlaws the Bull had a measure of respect.
There was a double bounty for every head of such stuff rolled into the
Bar Q, and quite often the Bull himself would join in the dangerous and
exciting business of running them to ground.</p>

<p>If the Bull looked upon men in the same way as on cattle, he had still
less respect for the female of the human species. With few exceptions,
he would snarl, spitting with contempt, women were all scrub stock,
easy stuff that could be whistled or driven to home pastures. A man had
but to reach out and help himself to whichever one he wanted.</p>

<p>By some such contemptuous speeches as these he had overruled the
alarmed objections with which his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>proposal had been received by the
timid, gentle girl from Ontario, whom he had found teaching in the
rural school planted in the heart of the then stern and rigid country.
It is true, he had thrown no lariat over the school teacher's neck, for
he had no wish to kill the thing he coveted, but the cowmen knew of
diabolical traps more ingenious than the Squeezegate in which a girl's
unwary feet might be ensnared.</p>

<p>She was an innocent, harmless creature, soft and devoted, the kind that
is born to mother things, but Mrs. Langdon had had only dream-things to
mother; the babes that came to her with every year were born only to
die immediately, as on some barren homestead the mother fought out her
agony and longing alone and with no one to minister to their needs.</p>

<p>That was the tragedy of this land in the early days, that in
innumerable cases the doctors' help would often come not at all, or
come too late to be of any avail.</p>

<p>Time could neither accustom nor compensate the wife of the cattleman to
those fearful losses, nor compensate her for them. And each time she
would cling to the hope that the Bull would send her, before it was
too late, to the city, to Calgary. Those were the years, however, when
the Bull had had neither time nor thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> for such unimportant things
as his wife's troubles. He was the type of man who will sit up all
night long with a sick cow, or scour the range in search of a lost one,
but look with indifference and callousness upon a woman's suffering,
especially if she be his wife. Those were the years when the Bull was
building up his herd. He was buying and stealing land and cattle. He
was drunk with a dream of conquest and power, intent upon climbing to
the top. It was his ambition to become the cattle king of Alberta&mdash;the
King Pin of the northwest country.</p>

<p>And when the years of power and affluence did come, it was too late to
help the cattleman's wife, for Mrs. Langdon had reached the age when
she could no longer bear a child. The maternal instinct which dominated
her, however, found an outlet in mothering the children of neighboring
ranchers, the rosy-cheeked papooses on the little squaws' backs, the
rough lads who worked upon the ranch, and she even found room in her
heart for Jake, the Bull's half-witted illegitimate son.</p>

<p>Jake was a half-breed, whose infirmity was due to a blow Langdon had
dealt him on the day when, as a boy, his mother having died on the
Indian Reserve, he had come to the Bar Q and ingenuously claimed the
Bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> as his father. As far as lay in her power, Mrs. Langdon had
sought to atone to the unfortunate half-breed for the father's cruelty,
and it was her gentle influence&mdash;she was newly married to the Bull at
the time&mdash;that had prevailed upon him to allow Jake to continue upon
the ranch. The boy worked about the house, doing the chores and the
wood chopping and the carrying of water. He was slavishly devoted to
his stepmother, and kept out of the reach of the heavy hand and foot of
the Bull, for whom he entertained a wholesome terror.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>Although this story chiefly concerns Bull Langdon, we must return at
this point to the three humble quarter sections aforementioned, which
are the scene of part of its action.</p>

<p>To the first of these the name of ranch or farm could only by courtesy
be applied. It was known as the "D. D. D.," the "D's" being short for
Dan Day Dump, as a neighboring farmer had once called the place, and
the name had stuck to it ever since.</p>

<p>It was on the extreme rocky edge of Yankee Valley, an otherwise
prosperous section of the "prairie" country, so named because most of
its settlers had hailed originally from the U. S. A.</p>

<p>Dan Day himself had come from the States, but he had found a wife in
Canada. They had "fetched up" finally at this sorry "stopping-off
place," as they called it then, where first they squatted, and later,
with the assistance of neighbors, who knew better than to let shiftless
newcomers encroach upon the more fertile lands hard by, they had staked
their homestead. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> Dan Day had put up the rackety shack and
lean-to which had provided shelter of sorts for his growing family and
stock, and in that rough environment the Day children had grown up like
Indians.</p>

<p>Time had taught the homesteader at least one lesson, which was that
he would never squeeze a living out of his barren acres. Day, as his
neighbors were wont to declare, shaking disapproving heads, was not
cut out to be a farmer. Nevertheless, they grudgingly gave him work,
putting up with his inept services chiefly because as a community
they waged unrelenting warfare against the stern approach of school
authorities, who had begun to query whether the size of the Day family
did not warrant the imposition upon the municipality of a new rural
school.</p>

<p>Time and growth, however, are things the farmer, most of all men, must
reckon with, and even as the crops leaped up tall and strong out of the
rich black virgin soil, even as the cattle and the stock flourished and
increased until they spread over all the wide pasture lands of Alberta,
so the Day progeny shot upward, and seemed, hungrily, to clamor for
their place in the world.</p>

<p>There were ten of them. A baby&mdash;and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> always a baby in that
family&mdash;of a few months old, a toddler of two, another of three,
another of five, twins of seven, a boy of nine, twins of twelve, and
Nettie, the eldest. The mother dying when she was fourteen, the girl
found herself faced with the desperate problem of fending and caring
for the whole wild and hungry brood of her brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Nettie was of that blonde type seen often in the northern lands. She
was a big girl, with milk-white skin and dead gold hair, a slow-moving,
slow-thinking girl, simple-minded and totally ignorant of the world
that lay beyond the narrow confines of their homestead land.</p>

<p>School had played no part in the life of Nettie Day. She knew vaguely
of the existence of books and papers, things she remembered vaguely as
having seen, but she had not been able to read them. She believed that
the world contained two kinds of folk, the rich and the poor. The rich
lived away off somewhere on big ranches, where the cattle were fat and
the grain grew high, though some lived also in the cities. Nettie had
heard of cities; her father had come from a small town in Oregon. As
for the poor folk, with simple resignation Nettie accepted the fact
that to them belonged such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> themselves, the Days, for whom life was
one unceasing struggle against hunger and cold.</p>

<p>Occasionally a neighboring farmer, riding across the range or bringing
home stray cattle, would drop in at the Day homestead and share the
meager meal shyly set out by Nettie, and as the years went by and the
girl began to unfold in the early blossoming of womanhood the visitor
might linger a while longer to stare curiously at this maturing product
of the D. D. D. Nettie possessed one true and unfailing friend in the
man who had brought her and her nine little brothers and sisters into
the world; who came periodically to scold, tease and teach; to clean
and work, himself, in an effort to bring some semblance of order into
the chaotic confusion that reigned in that shack.</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott, in spite of his twenty years in Canada, was still as
stubbornly Scotch as on the day he landed; He was admitted to be the
busiest man in the country, his practice extending from the prairie
to the mountains. He had brought into the world most of the children
born in that part of the country ever since he had planted his rough
homestead there. There were other families as helpless as the Days and
as dependent upon the "Doc" to scold and instruct them, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
not often that he found time to talk with Nettie. She would decide in
advance the questions she meant to ask him when his monthly visit came
round, but being so slow and shy, by the time the doctor had finished
his dissatisfied inspection of the family affairs, the questions had
all escaped her. But always the warm grip of his hand brought something
surging up within her that sought utterance and expression.</p>

<p>"Growing! Growing! Growing!" the Scotch doctor would growl, glaring
round at the circle of healthy, grimy faces, "like weeds! like weeds!"
Latterly, however, like the neighbors, he had begun to look longer
at Nettie, and with puckered brows he would change the word "weed"
to "flower." He told her she reminded him of a wild flower, and she
liked that&mdash;it pleased her that her doctor friend had picked her out,
as it were, from the weeds, and her bosom swelled with pride when he
appeared one day unexpectedly at the shack and took her with him across
the country to help care for a sick woman in a shack on the C. P. R.
quarter section which had been Dr. McDermott's own original homestead.</p>

<p>That swift running drive over the road allowances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> in the doctor's
democrat always stood out in her memory as one of the few sweet days in
her life.</p>

<p>It was early March, but a "Chinook," the warm wind which has its
origin in the Japanese current, had melted the flying snow of a March
blizzard; it was as though a miracle had been wrought; the Chinook had
sunk deep into the earth and thawed the last bit of frost out of the
ground. Streams were running along the roads, the sloughs were filling
to the top, the cattle no longer nibbled in the neighborhood of the
fenced-in hay and straw stacks, but hit down into the upspringing
grass, green already in this wonderful land. Eight-horse teams were
pulling plow, disc and harrow out into the fields, preparatory for an
early seeding. Overhead a great, warm sun sent its benevolent rays
abroad, filling sky and earth with a warm glow; the land was bathed
in sunlight. Small marvel that someone had fondly named it: "Sunny
Alberta, the Land of Promise."</p>

<p>If Nettie was slow of speech and shy, Dr. McDermott was Scotch and
brief. There was that, moreover, on his mind at this time, which
dismayed and concerned him deeply. It is not strange, therefore, that
as he whipped his horses to their top speed&mdash;they were upon an errand
that he knew was a matter of life or death&mdash;he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>forgot the girl at his
side, looking about her in a sort of trance.</p>

<p>All the world seemed good and bonny to Nettie at this time; life was
thrilling. The bumping, rickety old democrat was a luxurious coach,
the rough trails and road allowances, full of holes and mud slews, a
smooth highway over which she was being borne into a scene that spelled
romance.</p>

<p>She had never before had so wonderful a chance of seeing the whole
country, across to where, on the horizon, the mighty peaks of the Rocky
Mountains held their snowy fronts. The hills always stirred something
in Nettie that was vaguely yearning, something that thrilled even while
it pained. Though prairie born, and prairie raised, she aspired to the
hills, not knowing why, except that the hills seemed to her lifted up,
up, up, into the clouds themselves. She had a childlike faith that
"something good" would come to her out of the hills. That "something
good" she recognized with rapture in the young rider from the great Bar
Q who one autumn day had spent a never-to-be-forgotten hour at the D.
D. D.</p>

<p>For several days long files of the Bar Q cattle had been trailing down
from the hill country. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> being driven from the summer range in
the foothills to the grain ranches on the prairie where, in the shelter
of the long cattle sheds, or loose in the sunlit pastures where stood
the great straw and hay stacks, the mothers of the famous herd were
especially housed and nurtured during the winter months, in preparation
for the spring crop of calves.</p>

<p>This annual fall movement was an exciting event in the lives of the
young Days. The children kept count of every head of cattle that passed
along the road, and there was great excitement and glee the following
spring, when the herd returned to the foothills, with the pretty,
white-faced calves "at heel."</p>

<p>Nettie was no less thrilled than her small brothers and sisters by the
advent of the Bar Q cattle, and up to the time of her mother's death
she, too, had scrambled with them under and over barbed wire fences,
and scampered across pasture lands to reach the road in time to see the
cattle pour by. After her mother's death, things changed for Nettie.
The babies tied her to the house, and the best she could do was to go
as far as the edge of the corrals, a baby tucked under either arm, and
toddlers clinging to her skirts. Here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> standing upon a rail, she would
call across to the flying youngsters her admonitions to be careful.</p>

<p>That fall, however, hankering again to see the great herd from the
hills as it passed to the lower lands, Nettie scrubbed the faces of her
grimy little brood, arrayed them in clean jumpers made from bleached
flour sacks, piled them aboard the old hay wagon, to which "Tick," a
brother of thirteen, had already harnessed the team of geldings, and
taking up the reins in her competent hands, she started for the trail.</p>

<p>Nettie was a big girl, with the softly maturing figure of a young
Juno. She looked more than her fifteen years. Her hair was as gold as
the Alberta sun, whose warmth, together with her unwonted excitement,
brought a flush to either rounded cheek. Her blue eyes, wide and
candid, returned the smiles of the riders, who were visibly impressed
by the picture she made driving her wagonload of tow-headed children
out into the road. The eyes of the young men brightened; wide hats and
flowing ties were adjusted, as they rode on in the sunlight, whistling
and singing and whirling loose lariats in their hands. More than one of
them made a mental note of the necessity of seeking strayed cattle in
the near neighborhood of the D. D. D., and when the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> of the herd
disappeared down the grade, single horseman rode out of the bush and
paused alongside the Day wagon.</p>

<p>His broad face was sunburned, freckled, and ruddy, and wore a wide,
friendly smile. He looked very straight out of clear eyes, eyes often
seen in western Canada where men are ever gazing out over great
distances, eyes that seem to hold the spirit of the outdoors and the
freshness of unspoiled youth. The way he swept his large hat from his
head and held it over the pommel of his saddle had something in it
of unconscious grace and native courtliness, and he looked curiously
boyish with his thick crop of brown hair ruffled by the slight wind.</p>

<p>Had anyone in the Day wagon seen a roan heifer? "She" had given him a
"sight of trouble." Got into the bush half a mile down the grade, and
"hanged if she didn't get plumb out o' sight somewhere in the willows."</p>

<p>No one in the Day wagon had seen a roan heifer; and the inquirer,
screwing up his face, and scratching the side of his neck, ruminated in
puzzled wonder as to the whereabouts of the missing animal, his eyes
resting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> meanwhile, upon the lifted, glowing face of the girl in the
driver's seat.</p>

<p>While random conjecture and suggestion were being offered by each of
the boys and girls, the rider sat up suddenly alert and pointing toward
some invisible speck, which he declared was "back of the shack there,"
he touched spurs to the flanks of his broncho and was off toward the
house after the elusive lost one. But when the wagon pulled up into the
barnyard, and the children and Nettie scrambled down, and crossed the
yard to the house, they found the cowpuncher sitting disconsolately on
the step, fanning himself with his great hat. Shaking his head at the
shouted queries of the Day boys, as to whether he had found her, he
replied:</p>

<p>"Nope. Guess she's flewed the coop. Gosh! but I'm hungry. Guess I'd
better hop along and catch up with the bunch, before they bolt all o'
the grub."</p>

<p>Which remark, needless to say, brought a clamorous invitation to dinner
from the young Days, and after the usual protest at the trouble he'd
be making, accompanied by a questioning, rather wistful look toward
Nettie, who shyly seconded the children's invitation, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> "guessed,
well, mebbe I will, though don't go to any trouble for me."</p>

<p>Trouble! Nettie flew about the mean room, her cheeks aflame, her eyes
shining, her heart singing like a bird's within her, while the children
crowded about their guest, on whom, in his buckskin shirt, fur chapps,
gauntlets and cowboy hat, their young prairie eyes gazed as upon a hero.</p>

<p>It may, moreover, be recorded that Nettie was by no means the only one
through whose veins an exhilarating elixir seemed to be bounding like
champagne. Young Cyril Stanley at that moment was violently aware of a
thumping organ to the left of his cardiac region.</p>

<p>Love knows not time. It wells up in the human heart like the wave of
the ocean that may not be beaten down. Nettie Day, hurrying about the
kitchen, preparing a meal for the hungry stranger, and the stranger,
with a "kid" on either knee and the others pressed as closely to him as
space would allow, displaying his big jackknife, quirt, beaded hatband
and ticking watch to the delighted youngsters, looked at each other
across the space of that poor and meager room, it seemed, though they
could not have expressed it in words, that somehow life had become a
poem, a glad dancing song.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>The winter was long and harsh, with scarcely a single Chinook to
temper the intense cold. To Nettie, vainly seeking to cope with the
work, the noise and the disorder, which the shutting in of a dozen
husky youngsters must inevitably entail, and to Cyril Stanley,
conscientiously at work in the purebred camp of the Bar Q, the Alberta
winter had never seemed so long and grim. Cyril, however, found an
outlet for the new feelings that he did not find hard to analyze. An
Ontario-born boy, of pure Scotch ancestry, he was both sentimental and
practical. Though he had met her but once, he was certain that Nettie
was the only girl in the world for him, and with a canny eye to the
near future, he began immediately to prepare for the realization of
his dreams. It did not take Cyril long to make application for the
quarter-section homestead land, which lay midway between the Day place
and Dr. McDermott's original homestead. The savings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> several years
were prudently expended upon barbed wire and fence post.</p>

<p>Though the best rider and roper of the Bar Q, and in line for the
post of foreman of that tempestuous ranch, Cyril's faith was in the
grain land, and he purposed to develop his homestead as soon as he
could afford to do so. By sacrificing a certain amount of his pay,
he could leave the Bar Q in the slack seasons and put in a certain
amount of work each year upon his place. Already he possessed a few
head of cattle and horses, and he planned to trade some of these for
implements. He would begin the building of the house in the summer,
after the fencing was done. The boy's thoughts dwelt long and tenderly
upon that house all winter long. He had the heart and home hunger of
the man in the ranching country, who has come little into contact with
women, yet craves their companionship. Cyril's longing was the keener
in that he now found himself in love for the first time in his life.
He pictured Nettie in the house he would build, saw her moving about
preparing their meal, thrilled at the thought of their eyes meeting and
the touch of her hand in his. How she would light up the place.</p>

<p>Dreams these&mdash;dreams that kept the once easy-tongued <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Cyril dumb and
still, and aroused the good-natured questions of the fellows in the
bunkhouses. Little cared Cyril for their jokes. He knew that spring
would soon be there, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Spring, in fact, came early that year, ushered in miraculously on the
wings of a magnificent Chinook, which blew without ceasing for four
days and nights, its warm breath thawing the land so lately rigid with
cold.</p>

<p>Nettie, driving along the road in the Doctor's democrat, turned about
in the seat to stare, with mild wonder, at the three rolls of barbed
wire and the heaped-up willow fence posts that were piled on the
unbroken quarter by which they were now passing.</p>

<p>"My!" said Nettie, "looks like someone's took up this quarter. D'you
know Who they are, doc?"</p>

<p>"Let's see. Seems to me I did hear that a Bar Q hand had staked here."</p>

<p>At the word "Bar Q," such a rush of color flooded the girl's face that,
had the doctor been less intent upon driving the lagging team at a
speed they were totally unused to, he might have surprised the girl's
secret. But Dr. McDermott's eyes were fastened steadily ahead to where,
across the bald prairie, his own first home in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> Alberta thrust its
blunt head against the skyline. He was in a hurry to reach that long
deserted shack.</p>

<p>From up the grade the figure of a horseman stood out in silhouette
against the sun. Nettie's heart began to beat so wildly that she was
obliged to grip the sleeve of the doctor's coat.</p>

<p>"That's right," he growled. "Hold on tight. These roads are a mortal
disgrace&mdash;a disgrace to the community. Hello, there!"</p>

<p>Whip up, he hailed the rider, stopping long enough to give Cyril an
opportunity to join them.</p>

<p>"How do, doc! Business good?"</p>

<p>The rider had awkwardly lifted his wide hat, but his eyes lighted up as
he saw the other occupant of the cart, and over the girl's cheeks there
came a flush like the dawn.</p>

<p>"C'n I do anything for you, doc? Everything all right?"</p>

<p>"Nothing's right. Look at this road. It's an eternal disgrace&mdash;a
disgrace to the community."</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott cursed heartily and without stint.</p>

<p>"Should've made the grade in quarter the time."</p>

<p>"Where you bound for? Shall I ride along with you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may. Might need you. Sick wom&mdash;" He started to say "woman" and
then curiously changed, and blurted out angrily, "Lady over there."</p>

<p>"You don't say. Not at your old dump? Well, what's she doin' there?
Shall I go ahead, doc?"</p>

<p>"She owns the place. Don't know what happened, or when she arrived.
Drove by this morning. Saw the door down and the nails off the window.
Went in, and&mdash;Well, it's a sick woman&mdash;a very sick woman! Get up, you,
Mack!"</p>

<p>He growled angrily at the lagging horses.</p>

<p>Cyril rode close to the left-hand side of the democrat, his fur chapps
at times brushing the girl. They looked at each other, flushed, turned
away and looked back. For some time they rode along in an electric
silence, tongue-tied but happy. Conversation at last bubbled forth, but
of that which filled their young hearts to the brim no word was said;
they talked of the common everyday topics of the ranching country.</p>

<p>"Well, how's things at D. D. D.?"</p>

<p>"Not too bad. How's things at Bar Q?"</p>

<p>"Jake-a-loo. Stock in plumb good shape. Two hundred and eighty calves
dropped already. Expectin' all of two thousand this spring."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two thousand calves! Oh, my! That's an awful sight of cattle." She
sighed. "We just got six head."</p>

<p>"That's not too bad. Bull Langdon started with less than that. I got
twenty head of my own. Hope to ketch up with the Bull by'n by."</p>

<p>They laughed heartily at that. Not so much because of the wit and
brilliance of the remark, but because their hearts were young, the
spring had come, the sun was overhead and it was good to hear each
other's voices and to look into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>"What's your brand?"</p>

<p>"Mine? You don't say you never seen it yet?"</p>

<p>Again they went off into a happy gale of laughter.</p>

<p>"It's a circle on the left rib. Gotter look out. Bar Q's pretty much
the same. All the Bull's got to do to my circle is make a click to turn
it into a Q and brand a bar above that. Pretty easy, huh?"</p>

<p>"Oh-h, but he wouldn't do a thing like that!"</p>

<p>She was startled, palpably alarmed in his behalf, and that alarm was
sweet and dear to him.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't he, though! Sa-ay, where've you been living all your days
that you never heard how the Bull got his herd?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my, I did hear once, b-but I didn't suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> now he's so rich
and owns half the cattle in the country, that he'd do such things any
more."</p>

<p>"Oh, wouldn't he, though! Just give'm half a chance. He's got the
habit, you see, and habits is like our skin. They stick to us."</p>

<p>Again they laughed merrily at this witticism.</p>

<p>"Orders are," went on Cyril, expanding under the girl's flattering
attention and the shy admiration that shone from her wide blue eyes,
"to lick in any and all stuff runnin' loose around the country,
unbranded stuff, and stuff where the brand ain't clear. He give me the
tip himself. Said there'd be a five to the rider for every head rolled
in. Of course, I'm not losin' sleep about my stuff. I know just where
they are on the range, you betchu, and I'm not leavin' them out o'
sight too long. Thinkin' of tradin' them in, anyway, for&mdash;for&mdash;lumber
and implements."</p>

<p>"Lumber?" she repeated innocently.</p>

<p>"Yep. Goin' to build."</p>

<p>As his gaze sank deeply into Nettie's, her heart rose up and stood
still in her breast.</p>

<p>"Wh-what are you building?" she asked in a breathless whisper, so that
he had to bend down from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> horse to catch the question, and the
answer came with a boy's rich laugh:</p>

<p>"A <i>home</i>, girl!"</p>

<p>After that ecstatic sentence, and as if to relieve some of his pent-up
joy, Cyril rode forward at a quick canter, raced on ahead and back
again, bringing up beside the slow-traveling democrat.</p>

<p>The click of the doctor's whip, swinging above the horses' heads,
became the only sound in the vast silence of the prairie. Dr. McDermott
was considering the advisability of replacing his veterans which had
given him such long and valiant service over many years; their feeble
gait, though greatly to the taste of the engrossed young people,
aroused the indignation and wrath of the harassed doctor. Just then a
Ford, racing along the road at breakneck speed, jumped airily over a
hole and splashed a stream of thick, black slimy mud over the slowly
moving democrat and its occupants; it was the last straw in the cup of
Dr. McDermott's fury. There and then he vowed to pension the ancient
geldings, and get himself one of those infernal machines that had of
late been at once his torment and his temptation.</p>

<p>Ever and anon, Cyril would ride a bit ahead, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> as if to perform for
the girl's especial benefit, Bat, his mount, would rear up on his front
or hind feet, plunge and buck recklessly, and perform other thrilling
gyrations to the delight of his admiring audience of one. His wild
tricks, however, could not feaze the rider, who sat firm and graceful,
holding the peppery young broncho under complete and careless control.
The horse, a youngster of five, grown impatient at their lagging pace
along the trail, pulled and snorted in his efforts to race ahead of the
slow, plugging veterans.</p>

<p>"Oh, my," said Nettie&mdash;he was riding close again&mdash;"he's an awful
spirited animal, isn't he? Aren't you the least <i>bit</i> afraid?" And then
as he smiled at the idea, she added with the most simple and unfeigned
admiration: "You ride just as if nothing&mdash;no kind of horse&mdash;could ever
unseat you."</p>

<p>His chest swelled with pride, and he beamed down upon her.</p>

<p>"'Bout time I knew how to ride. Been ridin' sence I was a two-year-ole."</p>

<p>He offered another sally that brought forth the young laughter that so
rejoiced his ears:</p>

<p>"Say, didn't you notice that I'm a bowleg?"</p>

<p>Nettie looked at the brilliantly clad legs in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> orange-colored fur
chapps, under which their shape was utterly hidden. Their eyes met and
again they burst out laughing as if they had just heard the funniest
joke in the world.</p>

<p>They had turned now into the road allowance which ran directly up to
where the log cabin stood on the edge of the land. Something in the
stillness, the solitary look of that lone cabin planted on the bare
floor of the prairie sobered them, and they looked at the house with
apprehension. Inside, they knew, was an English woman&mdash;a "lady" had
said the doctor, and she was very sick.</p>

<p>Silently they dismounted. Dr. McDermott walked ahead of the trio, the
cowpuncher leading his horse and keeping close to the girl.</p>

<p>As they stepped into the dim shadows of the bare room, the figure
on the hard, home-made bed sat up suddenly. The face was thin and
pinched, with spots of hectic color on either high cheek-bone. The
woman's bright eyes were fixed upon them, full of suspicion and fierce
challenging. Her hair had been cut to the scalp; jagged and unlovely it
covered her head in grotesque tufts as if forcing its way out despite
the murderous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> shears. Crouched against the wall, she looked strangely
like some wild thing at bay.</p>

<p>Nettie's first impulse of shock and fear gave way to one of
overwhelming pity as she moved toward the bed. The bright, defiant eyes
met her own, and the woman moistened her dry lips:</p>

<p>"What do you want in my house? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm Nettie Day," said the girl simply, "and I just want to help you."</p>

<p>"I don't want any help," cried the woman violently. "All I want is to
be let alone."</p>

<p>The exertion, the violence of her reply brought on a fit of coughing
that left her panting and too weak to resist the hands that tenderly
lifted and held her. When the spasm had passed, she lay inert in
Nettie's arms, but when she opened her eyes again, they widened with a
strange light as they stared up fixedly at the pitying face bent above
her. The dry lips quivered, something that was pitifully like a smile
broke over the sick woman's face. She whispered:</p>

<p>"Why, you look&mdash;like&mdash;my mother did!"</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>More than a year had passed since that day in March when Nettie, the
doctor and Cyril Stanley had driven along the trail to the cabin on the
C. P. R. quarter. Slowly but surely, the place had changed. The sturdy
log house that had grown into being represented the efficient labor
of young Cyril Stanley's hands. He had built it in the "lay-off time"
he had taken that summer. Slowly the holes for the fence posts were
going into the ground around the entire quarter. Soon the "home" would
be ready for the radiant Nettie, and in a few more months Cyril would
leave the Bar Q, with savings enough to give him and Nettie a fair
start in life.</p>

<p>Things had moved also upon the quarter section of C. P. R. land where
lived in defiant solitude the woman who had resented and fought the
help forced upon her by the gruff Scotch doctor and Nettie Day.</p>

<p>Her name, it seemed, was Angella Loring, but some wag had named her
"Mr." Loring, because of her clipped hair and her workingman's attire,
and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> name had stuck, though Nettie Day called her "Angel."</p>

<p>Her appearance in Yankee Valley had caused the usual sensation always
created by a strange newcomer. There had been the usual wagging of
heads and tongues, and tapping of foreheads. The woman was a "bug," the
farm people of Yankee Valley had decided. At all events, she was the
kind of "bug" they found it prudent to keep at a safe distance. She had
met all overtures of friendship with hostility and contempt. She was on
her own land; she desired no commerce with her neighbors; and needed
no help. It was nobody's business but her own why she chose to dress
and live as she did. That was the substance of her replies to those
who ventured to call upon her, and when some jocular fellows, intent
on being smart, pressed their company upon her, she demonstrated her
ability to shoot straight&mdash;at their feet, so that for a time a joke
ran around the country about the number of young "bucks" who limped,
and for a time the jeering taunt, "Mr. Loring'll git you if you don't
watch out," was often heard. Thus she became a sort of bugaboo in the
popular imagination, but as time passed the country grew accustomed to
its woman hermit and gave her the wide berth she asked for.</p>

<p>She broke her own land and put in her own crop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> inadequately it is
true, but with a certain persistence and intensity which at first
amused, then slowly won the grudging respect and wonder of her
neighbors. She had few implements, and those the antiquated affairs
used by Dr. McDermott when first he had homesteaded in Alberta. Her
horses were poor, scrub stock, palmed off upon her by Bull Langdon,
who sent them down with the proposition that she could have the four
head in exchange for her services on the Bar Q cook car over the
harvesting period on his grain ranch. Cooks were rare and precious in
those years when not even a Chinaman was to be had for love or money.
The woman hermit considered the terms for a moment, and then, to the
surprise of the grinning "hand" who had brought both the horses and the
proposition, she accepted it.</p>

<p>She understood horses well enough, but not the kind used in Alberta for
farming purposes. Her acquaintance had been with the English saddle
horses. How should she know the type of draught horse necessary for the
plow, the disc, the harrow and the seeder? So she harnessed up the poor
stock advanced her by the Bull, obtained her seed by application to
the Municipality, and her crop went in. Cutworms ate it to the ground
before it had shown fairly above the soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Grimly and without altering her air of inimical aloofness, she went to
the Bar Q ranch, and over the harvest period cooked for thirty or forty
men. Throughout that time she dealt with the crew in absolute silence,
cooking and dishing up the "grub" and passing it out to them without
a word. She had never been known to address a voluntary sentence or
question to a soul on the place, with the single exception of the
half-breed Jake, who did her chores and wiped the dishes for her. When
Mrs. Langdon made overtures of friendship to her, she curtly told her
that she would "quit" if she were "interfered" with; she was in charge
of the cook car and was to be let alone.</p>

<p>In the fall she broke more land, and in winter she shut herself in her
shack, and no one, save Dr. McDermott who persisted in calling upon her
on his monthly rounds, saw her again till the spring, when she put in a
larger crop than the year before.</p>

<p>However, time allays even if it does not satisfy the hungriest
curiosity, and in a country like Alberta, even in the present day, we
do not scrutinize too closely the history or the past of the stranger
in our midst. Alberta is, in a way, a land of sanctuary, and upon its
rough bosom the derelicts of the world, the fugitive, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> hunted,
the sick and the dying have sought asylum and cure. The advent of a
newcomer, however suspicious or strange, causes only a seven days'
wonder and stir. Human nature is, of course, the same the world over,
and in the wake of curiosity, surmise, invention, slander reach forth
their filthy fingers to bespatter the lives of those we do not know.
Fortunately, however, curiosity is an evanescent quality in the
ranching country, partly for reasons of time and distance. We cannot
shout our gossip of a neighbor across hundreds of miles of territory,
and he who toils upon the land from sunrise until sunset has no leisure
to hustle from door to door with evil tales.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was one man in Alberta who knew something of the
history of this strange woman's past, even if he did not understand why
she had sought this strange isolation from her fellowmen.</p>

<p>She had failed to recognize in the country doctor who stubbornly forced
his society upon her, the stable lad who twenty-five years before her
father had sent away to college in Glasgow.</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott was one of Alberta's pioneer workers. When settlers
followed upon the heels of the missionary and the C. P. R., and planted
their homesteads on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> big raw land, Dr. McDermott was there to care
for and scold and direct them. He had attended his patients all over
the country, traveling in those days by any and all kinds of primitive
vehicle, on horseback, by ox wagon, by dog sled, and often on foot,
before the roads were staked, when there were no lines of barbed wire
fencing to mark the trail, and when a blizzard meant possible blindness
and death. He had gone to remote places to bring babies into the world,
not only gave medical aid to the mother but looked after the whole
household. He knew Alberta as a child knows his mother&mdash;knew that this
"last of the big lands," as they called it, was for those only who
were capable of seizing life with strong, eager hands. It was no place
for the weakling, or the feeble of heart, for Alberta was the Land of
Romance, the Land of Heartbreak, cruel and tender, remorseless and kind.</p>

<p>Free and independent by nature, it seemed incredible that the
doctor should have come of a race of servitors, men who for several
generations had served a single family, as groom and servant, and
always he experienced a deep sense of gratitude to the man who had
picked him out from amongst the humble McDermotts and given him the
opportunity for an education. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> had worked with the purpose of
justifying by his achievements his master's faith in his abilities,
and it had been a proud day for Angus McDermott when, cleared of all
encumbrances, free of mortgages and taxes paid to date, his land broken
and his rugged cabin planted upon it, he had deeded the beloved quarter
section back to the man who had paid for his education.</p>

<p>Now after the passage of the years, the daughter of his former master
had come to that bit of Alberta soil, seeking in her turn to wrest a
living from the land, fighting a desperate fight with poverty, disease
and the blows and buffets of the wild new land which "makes or breaks"
a man.</p>

<p>As he rode along the rough roads, chirping absently to the old geldings
that plugged slowly along, the doctor's mind persistently traveled
back to a sunny day in June in the old land. He was a barefooted boy
in a large stable yard. A little girl was there&mdash;a very little girl,
with thick, brown, curly hair, crushed under a Derby hat, and she was
leaning over from her seat on her pony's back to coax&mdash;to command
favors of the stable boy. She wished to ride Spitfire. Angus was not
to tell "Pop," which was her inelegant term for the Earl of Loring. He
was to bring the animal around to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> the far end of the south garden that
evening, and she would be there under the bushes. He was not to forget,
mind! He'd be sorry if he did.</p>

<p>He did not forget. He kept the tryst with the daughter of the earl,
but he brought not the forbidden horse. He well recalled the furious,
passionate little figure that crawled from out the bush and assailed
him with bitter reproach and blows. Mechanically, Dr. McDermott's hand
went up to the cheek where her crop had flashed, and he was moved
afresh by the memory of the child's wild imploring voice, begging
forgiveness, the touch of the small impetuous hand upon his hurt face,
and the soft smudge of her tear&mdash;drenched face against his own.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years ago! He rode on and on through the Alberta sunshine,
his wide Stetson tilted above a rugged face, whose chief charm lay in
the sturdy honesty of its expression.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>Nettie sat listlessly on the single step of the Day shack, her hands
loosely clasped in her lap. The ripening grain gleamed in the sunlight,
golden as her own thick braids. The field seemed to ripple and stir
under the breeze that moved over the heavily laden stalks.</p>

<p>This was a crop year, and even upon the rocky land of the D. D. D.
the grain pushed up resistlessly. Yet as she looked out upon those
waving fields, which represented largely the labor of her own and her
brothers' hands, Nettie felt no sense of gratification or pride. For
suddenly her world had changed and darkened.</p>

<p>The poor, shiftless, happy-go-lucky homesteader of the D. D. D. was
dead, and of all that family of twelve only she remained. County
officials had taken away the younger ones, who were to be "put out" for
adoption, while neighboring farmers had snapped up the growing boys, as
"likely timber for hard work."</p>

<p>The girl was quite alone, not knowing what was to become of her,
nor whither she could go. She thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> vaguely of the great city of
Calgary. There she could surely find work, but Nettie was a farm girl,
and to her mind the city meant eternal speed and noise, a feverish,
rushing activity which would only bewilder and terrify her.</p>

<p>She was a silent girl, given to day-dreaming, and the dreams of Nettie
Day were humble and simple enough. A clean, small cabin on a quarter
section of land; a cow or two; a few pigs; chickens; fields of grain,
oats, thick and tall; gleaming, silvery barley; the blue-flowering
flax; waves of golden wheat. Overall men upon the implements, and
herself in a clean kitchen, cooking a meal for the harvest hands, and
always her dream embraced within its circle one whose friendly face was
tanned and freckled by the sun, whose smile was wide and all-embracing,
and who looked at Nettie with eyes that spoke a language that needed no
tongue.</p>

<p>"Some day soon," he had said to Nettie, "you and me will be in our own
home, girl."</p>

<p>"Soon" to the Scotch-Ontario boy meant a year or two,' maybe a year' or
two more than that; by which time the home for Nettie would be snug and
complete, with a safe nest-egg in the bank or on the range.</p>

<p>But now everything had changed. Her home had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> been broken up. There was
to be an auction of the poor stuff upon the place, to raise the price
of the mortgage upon the land.</p>

<p>Nettie felt helpless and forsaken. She missed her father and her
little brothers and sisters cruelly, and dreaded to think how the baby
might be faring, so dependent had it been upon her own care. Her gaze
wandered irresistibly off to the hills, watching, a lump in her throat,
for Cyril to come.</p>

<p>Though unable herself to read or write, Nettie had contrived to
dispatch word to the rider of the Bar Q, through the medium of the
half-breed, Jake, who had ridden by on the day after her father's
death. She could not know that he had been stricken down by a fit of
the epilepsy, to which he was subject, and long delayed on the trail.</p>

<p>With the noon hour came the farmers and ranchers, riding in from far
and near, for a country auction in Alberta, will bring out the people
as to a celebration or a fair. They came to the Day auction with picnic
baskets and hampers, in all kinds of vehicles, even by automobile or on
horseback.</p>

<p>The auctioneer was a little man, with a barking voice. He hustled
about the place, appraising the stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> and implements, the household
effects and furniture. The few head of cattle and horses were driven
into a hastily constructed corral of large logs. Bull Langdon held the
mortgage upon the D. D. D., and he expected to get his money back with
compound interest.</p>

<p>The sale began at the house, the home-made bits of furniture telling
their own tale of how Nettie and her mother had been forced to work.
These sold for practically nothing, and some of them created coarse
laughter, as they were shoved out into the jovial circle of farm folk.
As bit by bit the familiar pieces were brought from the house and
dumped upon the ground for the amusement and inspection of the farmers,
Nettie, unable to bear the pain of that pitiful sale, sought refuge in
the barn, where she stood looking down at the fat sow, her father's
especial pride and care, and the thirteen young ones that had come with
the spring. Dry sobs tore her heart, and when a Bar Q "hand" spoke to
her, she looked up with her drenched face all twisted like that of a
wounded child's.</p>

<p>"'Tain't no use to cry about nothin'," said Batt Leeson, with affected
roughness. "Them pigs'll fetch a fancy figger, though five of 'em's
runts."</p>

<p>"I w-wasn't thinkin' of the pigs," said Nettie. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> was w-wondering
when Cyril Stanley would come. He's&mdash;a friend of mine," she added with
a gulp of pride through all her grief.</p>

<p>"Him? Say, he's up at the purebred camp at Barstairs. Gittin' the herd
in shape for the annual fair circuit. We got the greatest champeen
bulls in the world, take it from me. You needn't look for him, girl.
He's on his job."</p>

<p>She turned pale at this news, though Cyril had warned her of the
possibility of his being dispatched to the Bull camp at Barstairs. She
knew now that it would be impossible for him to come.</p>

<p>With a sickening sense of utter desertion, she returned to where the
auction was continuing briskly, and with considerable hilarity. The
auctioneer was jumping up and down, as a small hull was driven into the
circle of log fencing.</p>

<p>"Oh, boys!" yelled the auctioneer (a one-time showman), "what have
we here? This ain't no scrub bull! Betchu he's almost pure Hereford!
Betchu he's got a good strain of Bar Q in him! Betchu he's an A No. 1
calf-thrower. What am I offered? Gentlemen, here's the chance o' your
lifetime."</p>

<p>A loud laugh burst from the circle of farmers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> Bull Langdon came
closer to the fence, and squinted appraisingly at the animal.</p>

<p>"Dare say he ain't in prime shape&mdash;poor nibblings on the D. D. D. as
you know, gentlemen, but betchu you turn 'im out on some reglar grass,
he'll turn yound and 'sprize you. They's the makin's of a smooth Bull
in that fellow!"</p>

<p>"How old is he?" yelled a wag, making a horn of his hands. "Seems like
I seen him at D. D. D. when Dan Day first pulled in."</p>

<p>Before the laughter that swelled up from this sally had half died down,
a girl's young savage voice broke upon the gathering. Eyes blazing,
breathlessly facing the circle of rough men, Nettie sprang to the
defense of the home product.</p>

<p>"It's a lie, Jem Bowers, and you know it! He ain't old. He ain't more'n
six year old, and he just looks that way&mdash;spare and done, 'cause we
never had enough feed for our stock. Dad listened to you-all, and
staked his land on this rocky part, while you got the fat places. That
bull ain't old, and don't you dare say he is. I guess <i>I</i> ought to
know, 'cause I raised him myself from a calf."</p>

<p>A silence greeted this outburst from the girl. Eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> shifted, tongues
were stuck into cheeks. Compunction not unmixed with admiration showed
on the faces of the farmers, aware possibly for the first time of the
existence of Nettie, who until then had shrunk into the background.
Bull Langdon, arms akimbo, had moved from his position by the fence,
and for the first time his appraising eye fell fully upon Nettie. He
looked the girl over slowly from head to foot, and as his bold gaze
swept her his eyes slightly bulged and he licked his lips.</p>

<p>Her outburst, probably the first in all her gentle life, had left her
flushed and breathless, and as her anger subsided, she shrank before
the united gaze of that crowd of rough men gathered to buy up their
poor possessions. She drew back into the shadow of the house and the
sale went on.</p>

<p>Soon it was over. Auctioneer and buyers tramped across the muddy
barnyard to the house, to make their reckoning there. As they came to
the step Nettie met them, her hands spasmodically clasped.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;everything&mdash;sold?" she asked the auctioneer quaveringly.</p>

<p>"Every last thing upon the place gone under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> hammer. Did pretty
well, I'll say. Not too bad prices."</p>

<p>"Then there'll be something for my brothers and sisters?"</p>

<p>"Not on your life they won't. Scarcely enough to satisfy the mortgage
and pay up the debts. You ask Mr. Langdon there. He holds the mortgage,
and he's bought in most o' the truck hisself."</p>

<p>Nettie turned her head slowly and looked in the face of Bull Langdon.
Then her head dropped. The Bull had stepped forward. One big, thick
forefinger went up to the auctioneer, as it had risen when he had
bought head by head the stock and cattle.</p>

<p>"How about the gell? My wife needs a good strong gell for the
housework, and I'm willin' to take her along with her dad's old truck."</p>

<p>One of the farmers' wives, a pale, anemic creature who had sidled next
to Nettie, whispered:</p>

<p>"Don't chu go with him, Nettie. He ain't no good."</p>

<p>As the eye of the Bull fell upon her, the woman quailed and, in a
panic, she said aloud:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Langdon's the kindes' woman in this country. You'd be workin' for
a good woman, Nettie. You're a lucky girl to get the chance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>All that Nettie was thinking then was that Cyril Stanley worked for the
Bar Q. She would be near Cyril; they would meet, perhaps, daily. That
thought sent her toward Bull Langdon with a hopeful light in the eyes
she raised shyly, though fearfully, toward him.</p>

<p>"I'll go, Mr. Langdon," said Nettie Day. "I got to get a place anyway,
and I might as well go along with you."</p>

<p>The Bull withdrew his glance. Finger up again he summoned his "hands."</p>

<p>"Round up them dogies, you Buzz. You, Batt, bring along the pigs in the
wagon. Damn you, Block, git them horses back. Where in the h&mdash;&mdash; d'yer
think we're rangin'? You, Boob, roll off o' your horse there. Saddle
that pinto for the gell. Here, tighter on the cinch. Shorten them
stirrups. Here, gell!"</p>

<p>His big hand went under her arm, helping her to mount the horse, but it
closed over the smooth yielding flesh, pressing it hard. As he tested
the length of the stirrups, he looked up into her face with such an
expression that she was suddenly filled with alarm and terror. His big
hand continued to tug at the stirrup strap, his arm pressing against
her knee, and she said hastily:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let 'em alone. Them stirrup's is all right. I like them long."</p>

<p>She shoved her foot into the leather thong and, slapping the horse
across the neck with the reins, she urged it along. She had a sudden
impulse to flee, though from what she could not have said; she was
possessed with a furious urge to leave far behind her the huge cowman,
with his wild, possessive eyes.</p>

<p>She flew along the trail at a breathless gallop, and it was only when
his hand reached across the neck of her horse and planted itself upon
the pummel of her saddle that she realized that he had never left her
side.</p>

<p>"Hi, there, you don't want to run as a starter. Take it easy."</p>

<p>On and on they went, across country, past the widespreading pasture
and grain fields, odorous of the bumper crop which that year was to
put Alberta upon the grain map of the world, past the homely little
log cabin that Cyril had built for her, and past the C. P. R. quarter,
where the cropped-haired woman lived in her hermit-like seclusion. On
and on, till the higher grades began and they climbed gradually upward
toward the hill country.</p>

<p>Straight ahead, under a sunset that overspread the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> whole sky with
a glow of red and gold, the mighty Rocky Mountains rose like a vast
dream before them. The girl and the man rode side by side into that
sunset, while the perfect stillness of the Alberta evening closed in
about them. Nettie lost herself once more in her old aspirations as the
nearness of the long-yearned-for hills drew nearer. Sweet and wistful
thoughts of Cyril calmed and reassured her. The man riding beside
her was forgotten, forgotten everything but the spell of the Alberta
twilight, and the dear thoughts of her love.</p>

<p>At last they drew up before one of those great Alberta ranch gates,
with log rails ten feet long. The Bull had alighted and opened the
gate, and they were cantering up the hill.</p>

<p>In Alberta the sunlight lingers till late into the night, and a mellow
glow suffuses the land, gilding even the meanest spots and turning all
the country into dim oceans and atolls of beauty. Under this light, the
white and green ranch buildings of the Bar Q shone like a little city
planted upon a hilltop, and at this first sight of the great Bar Q the
girl from the Dan Day Dump caught her breath in awe and admiration.</p>

<p>The Bull had again dismounted, and Nettie, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> hand under
her arm, also found herself lifted to the ground; but instead of
withdrawing his arm, the cowman kept it about her possessively, and
drew her closely to his side. She stared, fascinated, into the face so
close to her own.</p>

<p>"That pinto's yours, gell," said Bull Langdon, "and if you're the right
kind o' gell, and treat the Bull right, it's the first o' the presents
you'll be gettin'!"</p>

<p>Nettie shrank back, but she tried valiantly to hide her fear and
repulsion. She said breathlessly:</p>

<p>"I don't want nothing that I don't earn."</p>

<p>At that the Bull laughed&mdash;a big, coarse chuckle.</p>

<p>"You'll get all that's comin' to you, gell," he said.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>Life was pleasant for Nettie Day at the Bar Q, where, in the pink
and white gingham house dresses supplied by Mrs. Langdon, she looked
prettier every day.</p>

<p>The clean and spacious ranch house, shining with sunlight, was a
revelation to the girl who had lived all of her life in the two rooms
of the poor shack with her parents and her nine little brothers and
sisters.</p>

<p>It flattered the vanity of Bull Langdon to have a "show place" on
the Banff National Highway. He had built the main ranch house upon
the crest of a hill that commanded the road to Banff, and the wide,
rambling buildings, ornate in design and brightly painted, had been
placed where they would show up well from the road, so that all who
traveled along the highway would slow up for a view of the Bar Q.</p>

<p>Nettie's advent was both a surprise and a joy to the wife of the
cattleman, who took a childish pride in at last "keeping a girl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>For a number of years the Bar Q had maintained a cook car, whither the
"hands" went for "grub." It was on such a vehicle that Angela Loring
had served. Now a thin and musty smelling Chinaman dominated the car, a
shrinking, silent figure, who banged down the chow before the men, and
paid no heed to protest or squabble, save when the "boss" came in, when
Chum Lee became frenziedly busy. In winter, the Chinaman was moved to
the Pure-Bred Bull camp at Barstairs, and the men left at the foothill
ranch, "batched" in the bunkhouses.</p>

<p>Though the main cooking was done on the cook car, there yet remained an
enormous amount of work at the ranch house, for besides the housework,
the bread and butter for the ranch were made there by Mrs. Langdon. She
"put down" the pork in brine, cured and smoked it; made hundreds of
pounds of lard, sausage meat, headcheese, corned beef and other meat
products. She made the soap, looked after the poultry and vegetable
garden, she canned quantities of fruit and vegetables for the winter
months. She was always working, always running hither and thither
about the house, hurrying to "have things ready," for her husband had
a greedy appetite, and her mind was exclusively occupied in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>devising
ways and means of propitiating and pacifying him.</p>

<p>Of late, however, her health had been visibly failing. The long years
of hard work, the tragedy of the yearly still-born baby, life and
association with the overbearing cattleman had gradually taken their
toll of the strength of Bull Langdon's wife.</p>

<p>Bull was what is known in the cattle world as a "night rider." In the
earlier days it was said he did all of his "dirty work" at night,
moving and driving bunches of cattle under cover of darkness. Rivalry,
strife and bitter enmity are a commonplace of life in the cattle
country, and the Bull vented his vindictive spite upon his neighbors
by slipping their herds out of pastures and corrals, and driving them
over the tops of canyon and precipice. Those incursions were, however,
events of the past. The cowman was cautious now that he had arrived at
a place of security and power. Rustling and stealing were dangerous
undertakings in those days when the trails had turned into highways,
and small ranches were beginning to dot the edges of the range.
Moreover, the mounted police were less easy to influence and intimidate
than the former Indian agents had been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Night riding had remained one of his habits, however, and one that told
heavily upon the wife, who would always wait up for his return, with
supper always ingratiatingly ready.</p>

<p>For some time symptoms of a coming breakdown had been ominously evident
to Mrs. Langdon, but she persistently fought against the prospect of
becoming an invalid. She had an ingenuous faith, imbibed from tracts
and books that had drifted into her hands in her teaching days; she
denied the existence of evil, pain or illness in the world, and when
it pushed its ugly fist into her face, or wracked her frail body, she
had a little formula that she bravely recited over and over again, like
an incantation, in which she asserted that it was an error; that she
was in the best of health, and that everything in the world was good
and beautiful and in the image of God. Whether she deluded herself or
not, it is certain that this desperate philosophy, if such it could be
called, was the crutch that had upheld her and kept her sane throughout
the turbulent years of her life with Bull Langdon, so that she had
never lost her faith in mankind, and had remained curiously innocent of
wrong.</p>

<p>She hailed Nettie's coming, therefore, as a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>"demonstration" of her
faith, and welcomed the strong, willing, cheerful girl with a grateful
heart and open arms.</p>

<p>It was pleasant for a change, to take things easy; to have all the
heavier work done by the tall, competent girl, and, better than the
relief from the hard labor, was the companionship of another woman in
the ranch house. Only a woman who has been isolated long from her own
sex can appreciate what it means when another woman comes into her life.</p>

<p>Nettie would place a rocking chair for her mistress on the back
veranda, bring the basket of mending, and with her slow, shy smile, say:</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Langdon, you fall to on them socks, and leave me to do the
work."</p>

<p>This Mrs. Langdon would do, and Nettie would bring her work on to the
veranda, the one sewing or crocheting, the other churning and working
the butter, kneading the bread or preparing the vegetables for the day.
Work thus became a pleasure, and Mrs. Langdon's soft voice chattering
of many happy topics made a pleasant accompaniment to their work. If
Nettie went indoors to work, Mrs. Langdon soon followed her. She took
pride in teaching Nettie her own special recipes, and they would both
laugh and exclaim over the mistakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> or success of the girl, who was
all eagerness to learn. Slowly a feeling warmer than mere friendship
drew the two women together.</p>

<p>Although it was against the rules for the Bar Q "hands" to come to the
ranch house, save when summoned by the Bull, or on some special errand,
Nettie's presence there was widely known and commented upon, and many
were the ingenious devices invented by the men to obtain a sight of
or a word with the girl. Bull, however, was more than ever on the
watch for an infraction of this rule, and more than one employee found
himself fired for loitering in the neighborhood of the ranch house
or suffered the indignity and pain of a blow from the boss's heavy
hand. Harvest time came at last to the prairie, where Bull Langdon had
a great grain ranch, and thither the owner of the Bar Q departed to
superintend the harvesting operations.</p>

<p>From time immemorial lovers have found a way to meet, and Cyril and
Nettie were not long in solving their own problem.</p>

<p>Nettie Would slip from the house after supper, for Mrs. Langdon went
early to bed, as farmers do. Between the house and a clump of willows
there was a small field, behind it a deep coulee, where the wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>raspberries and gooseberries grew in profusion. There, hidden by
the thick growth, Nettie would go to pick berries, stopping ever and
anon to listen for a sound that only she and Cyril understood, the
long-drawn whistle that was like the call of an oriole. At the sound of
that musical note, Nettie would stop picking, and, with parted lips,
shining eyes and beating heart, she would wait for her lover to come to
her in the deep bush.</p>

<p>This was the season when the daylight lingered far into the night;
when the soft light of the late sun lay romantically upon the still
and sleeping land. Young Cyril and Nettie would sit on a knoll, with
the berry bushes all about and above and below them, and with clasped
hands, thrilling at each other's nearness, they would murmur their
joyful confidences and hopes.</p>

<p>Cyril was what the country folk would have described as "slow" with
girls, and Nettie was as innocent as a child. She had never had
companions of her own age, not even a girl friend, and Cyril was her
first "beau." This simple holding of hands was rapture for these two,
an exciting adventure that made them tremble with a vague longing for
something more. With the clumsy shyness of the country boy who has
known no women, it had taken Cyril two weeks to find courage and power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to put his arm awkwardly about the girl's waist. That daring progress,
full of joyous excitement, was the prelude to something he had not
foreseen. The close pressure of the girl's warm young body against his,
the involuntary raising of her face, as it almost touched his own,
brought the inevitable consequence. For the first time in either of
their lives they kissed. Lost in that single, ever closer embrace, time
and place, knowledge of all else on earth, vanished from their minds
as, amidst the dense berry bushes, they clung ecstatically together.</p>

<p>Upon their blissful dream, a harsh voice broke. Even as they drew
apart, still heavy with the lassitude of the new rapture they had but
just discovered, they dimly recognized the voice of Bull Langdon. From
somewhere in the direction of the corrals, he was calling for his
"hands." They could hear him cursing, and knew he must have ridden up
noiselessly, and annoyed at finding no one about the place was venting
his temper in this fashion.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" murmured Nettie, drawing half out of Cyril's arms and
unconsciously leaning towards him, "he'll be wantin' you, Cyril."</p>

<p>"Let'm want," said the boy, hungry again to feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> the touch of those
warm lips upon his own. "I'm not workin' nights for no man, and if he
ain't satisfied, I guess I can quit any old time now. You say the word
when, Nettie. I'm ready for you, girl. And Nettie&mdash;give us another
kiss, will you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cyril, I got to get to the house. Mrs. Langdon's gone to bed, and
he'll be lookin' for something to eat, and it's not her place to get
his meals when I'm here to do the work."</p>

<p>"You won't have to work for no one but me soon, Nettie. I'll take care
of you for the rest of your days. Nettie, I never kissed a girl before.
That is true as God."</p>

<p>"Neither did I&mdash;never kissed a fellow."</p>

<p>"Kiss me again, then."</p>

<p>This time she remained in his arms for a moment only as the clamorous
voice of Bull Langdon was heard close at hand, his words, causing
Nettie to tear herself away in fear.</p>

<p>"Where's that gell? Why ain't she on her job?"</p>

<p>Nettie clambered up the slope of the coulees and went running across
the grass to the house. As she paused at the wide opened door, her
basket still on her arm, Bull Langdon, now in his seat, his legs
stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> out before him, turned around to stare at her, his fierce,
covetous glance, as always, holding her fascinated and breathless with
vague terror.</p>

<p>"Where've ye been at this early hour of the night?"</p>

<p>"I been picking berries," faltered Nettie, trying vainly to steady her
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have, heh?"</p>

<p>Her cheeks were redder than any berries that ever grew and her eyes
shone star bright. Her white bosom rose and fell with the thrill of her
late adventure and her sudden fear.</p>

<p>"Pickin' berries in the night, huh? You're smart, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it was light as day you see and I don't mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's see what you got."</p>

<p>He reached out seemingly for the basket, but his hand closed over the
handle upon hers. Gripping it tightly with his other hand he lifted the
cover and peered into the empty basket.</p>

<p>"Let go my hand!" she cried in a stifled voice. "You're hurtin' me!"</p>

<p>For answer he possessed himself of the other and steadily drew her
nearer and nearer to him. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> struggled and twisted in his grasp,
suppressing her desire to scream for fear that her mistress might hear.
But, in fact, it was the clip clop of Mrs. Langdon's loose bedroom
slippers on the stairs that brought her release.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langdon, her hair in paper curlers and with a gray flannellete
kimono thrown over her night dress, hurried down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bill&mdash;" She was the only person who never called him "Bull"&mdash;"is
it you? Are you back? I'm so sorry I didn't hear you get in or I'd a
been down at once. We'll have something ready for you in a minute.
Nettie, bring some of that fresh headcheese, and cut it from the new
bowl, mind you, and maybe Mr. Langdon'd like something to drink too.
You made butter today, didn't you? Well, bring some fresh buttermilk,
or maybe you'd like something hot to drink. Which'd you rather have,
Bill?"</p>

<p>He never replied to her many light questions and she seldom expected
him to. She nodded and smiled at Nettie and the girl hurried to the
pantry. Mrs. Langdon fluttered about her husband, helping him to
remove his heavy riding boots and coat, and putting away his hat and
gauntlets. He endured her <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>ministrations, but in spite of her chatter
and numerous questions he remained curiously silent. When Nettie
brought the tray with its fresh cut homemade headcheese and thick layer
cake and buttermilk he drew up before it and ate in a sort of absorbed
silence.</p>

<p>"Will you be wanting me any more tonight, Mrs. Langdon?" asked Nettie.</p>

<p>"No, Nettie, thank you. Run along to bed. If Mr. Langdon needs anything
else I'll get it. Good-night, dear."</p>

<p>Bull, having finished the last of the food before him, reached for his
boots and began again to pull them on.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bill, you're not goin' out again, are you?" exclaimed Mrs. Langdon
with nervous anxiety.</p>

<p>He tightened his belt without speaking, his big chest swelling under
his moosehide shirt. Spurs rattling, he tramped across the room and out
into the yard.</p>

<p>At the bunkhouse lights were out and all hands save one abed. Cyril
sat on the edge of his bunk, still dressed, chin cupped in his hands,
giving himself up to his dreams.</p>

<p>The great bulk of the cattleman filled the doorway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> His forefinger up,
he beckoned to Cyril. The young man stood up and with a glance back at
his sleeping mates he joined his employer outside the bunkhouse.</p>

<p>Clenched hands on hips, a characteristic attitude, the Bull scrutinized
in the now steadily deepening dusk of the night the young fellow
sturdily and coolly facing him, apparently unmoved and unafraid.</p>

<p>"Want chu to be ready first thing in the morning to ride over to
Barstairs. Want chu to git them bulls in shape for the circuit. Goin'
to exhibit in St. Louis, Kansas City, Chicago, San Francisco and other
cities in the States. You do well by the bunch here and there's a bonus
on your pay and you go along with the herd to the U. S."</p>

<p>Until this night the unexpected promotion would have elated Cyril. Now,
in spite of his astonishment, he hesitated, and in his slow Scotch way
turned the matter over in his mind. After a moment he said:</p>

<p>"I don't know as I want the job, boss. Fact is, I'm thinkin' of
quittin'. Thinkin' of goin' on my own."</p>

<p>"On your own! You ain't got nothin' to go on your own with."</p>

<p>"I got my homestead. House's built, land partly fenced. I traded in my
cattle for implements and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> got six head of horses left, and that's
not too bad as a starter."</p>

<p>"How far d'you think you can git on that much unless you got a stake
behind you?"</p>

<p>The young man weighed this question thoughtfully and carefully. A bit
sadly he replied:</p>

<p>"Not very far, but it'll do as a starter, and next year&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Next year ain't here yet. Besides it depends on what you're countin'
on. You aimin' to get married?"</p>

<p>Somehow the question infuriated the Bull so that he shot it at the
boy, despite his effort at self-control and his eyes blazed through
the darkness. But Cyril was too absorbed in his own dreams to note the
Bull's voice or manner. After a pause he answered slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You can't raise no family on what you got now," said the Bull
hoarsely. "Things ain't the same as when I started in. You better wait
a year or two. Take on this proposition I'm offerin' you and you'll
be in better shape to do the right thing by the gell you marry then.
There's a ten dollar a month raise for you and a bonus of a hundred at
the end of the season."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>A long pause, as this sunk into Cyril, and he slowly weighed the matter
in his mind. A few months more or less would matter little to him and
Nettie. The money would mean a lot. There were certain articles he had
set his heart on buying for Nettie for the house, household utensils,
of which a country traveling salesman, who had put up overnight at the
Bar Q, had shown him enticing samples. Soon his mind was made up.</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right, boss. I'm on. Barstairs, eh? I'll be on the job
first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>But when he rode out in the quiet dawn, with no one but Jake to bid him
good-by, Cyril's heart was heavy, and as he went by the ranch house his
glance sought Nettie's window, in the vain hope that she might by some
chance be up and in sight. He had given Jake a message for her and felt
sure that she would understand. It was a common occurrence for riders
to be despatched on such trips as this, and Cyril was of a race that
always puts duty before pleasure. Farsighted and canny, he was prepared
to serve and wait an extra year if need be for the girl he loved.</p>

<p>At the thought of that future, shared with Nettie, his heart lifted.
The grayness of the approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> dawn grew slowly lighter and the
miracle of the sunrise broke over the sleeping land. Far and wide on
all sides stretched an incomparable sky, a shadowy, gilded loveliness,
as if a misty veil were slowly being unrolled till there burst into
full bloom the marvelous sunglow of Alberta. Cyril's spirits rose with
the sun and as his horse loped along the trail to Barstairs he lifted
up his young voice and sang.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>The days were getting longer. The fall round-up was under way and the
Bull rode the range with his men. For a week long files of cattle had
been pouring down from the hills to meet in the lower pastures of the
ranch and automatically form into symmetrical rank that moved lowing
before the drivers to the corrals and pens where they were sorted over
and separated.</p>

<p>It was a period of torture for the cattle for the Bar Q branded,
dehorned and weaned in the early fall. Day and night the incessant
crying of over two thousand calves and outraged mothers, penned in
separate fields or corrals, rent the air.</p>

<p>The round-up was an early and swift one that year for Bull Langdon
was due to leave in early November for the States with his purebred
bulls. He seemed possessed of inexhaustible energy and vitality and no
amount of riding appeared to tire him. It was no uncommon thing for
him after a night and day of riding to bring up finally at the ranch
house at midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> and sit down to the big meal prepared by the girl
whom he would summon with a thump upon her door. Little conversation
passed between them at these times, but once when the cattleman had
volunteered the information that they were about through Nettie said,
with apparent relief:</p>

<p>"Then there will be no more branding. I'm glad of that."</p>

<p>The cattleman leaned across the table, his elbows upon it and a knife
and fork in either hand. His meaning glance pinned the girl fairly.</p>

<p>"One more head," he said. "I'll put my personal brand upon that
maverick before I go."</p>

<p>She felt as if an icy hand were clutching at her heart.</p>

<p>The following day she was sent to Morley, an Indian trading post, where
was the nearest post office for the Bar Q mail. It was eight miles from
the ranch and Nettie went on horseback, returning in about two and a
half hours, in time to get the supper.</p>

<p>There was no one about the place when she rode into the corrals.
Dismounting, she unsaddled her horse, hung bridle and saddle in the
barn, and let the horse out to pasture. Hurrying to the house she
found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> big kitchen deserted. Usually when the girl went off on
long errands Mrs. Langdon prepared the supper, but Nettie supposed her
mistress was taking her afternoon nap. So she busied herself with the
preparation of the supper. She peeled the potatoes and set them on the
range, quickly beat up a pan of buttermilk biscuits and put them in the
oven. Her table set, she sliced the cold meat and put the kettle on for
tea.</p>

<p>Having finished, and there being still no sign of Mrs. Langdon, she ran
upstairs and tapped upon her door. There was no reply. Nettie opened
the door and looked in. The room was empty and the wide-open closet
door revealed the fact that it had been stripped.</p>

<p>A wave of fear swept over the girl; she ran panting downstairs and
out into the barnyard. Not a "hand" was about, though far across the
pastures she could see the fence riders riding toward the ranch, their
day's work done. Jake, driving in the six milk cows, came over the
crest of the hill and loped slowly down to the barnyard, stopping to
water his horse. He did not see Nettie at first waiting for him at the
cowshed and when he did began to jabber without dismounting. One by one
the cows went into their stalls and stood, bags full, patiently waiting
to be milked. Jake, full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> of his news, dismounted. He had a pronounced
impediment in his speech and when excited became almost unintelligible.</p>

<p>"Mis' Langdon&mdash;her gone off&mdash;off&mdash;off&mdash;&mdash;" He pointed vividly toward
the mountains. "Rode on nortermobile to a station. Goin' far away on
train&mdash;choo-choo&mdash;coo!"</p>

<p>Nettie stared at him blankly. She could barely understand the bare fact
that her mistress was gone and in her anxiety she plied the boy with
questions.</p>

<p>"Where had she gone? When? Who had gone with her? Why did she go? What
had she taken? How long was she to be gone?"</p>

<p>As desperately she shook the half-breed's ragged sleeve in her
impatience to make him understand her the honk of an automobile horn
caused her to look toward the garage and there she saw the Bull backing
in the car. She hurried across the barnyard, her fear of the man
forgotten in her intense anxiety about her mistress.</p>

<p>In his characteristic pose at the wide door of the garage he awaited
her approach.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is it true that Mrs. Langdon has gone away?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yep. Just taken her to the station. Gone up to Banff."</p>

<p>"Banff! Will she be gone for long?"</p>

<p>She hardly realized that her lips were quivering and her eyes were so
full of tears that she could not see the strange expression on the
Bull's face as he looked down gloatingly upon her.</p>

<p>The soft golden sunset was all about them and the brooding hush of the
closing day lent a beauty and stillness to the evening that was full of
poetry, but the man, with his calculating, bulging eyes, saw nothing
but her softly maturing loveliness, the rounded curve of her bosom, the
white softness of her neck, the rose that came and went in her cheeks,
the scarlet lips that aroused in his breast a tormenting passion such
as he had never experienced for any woman before.</p>

<p>Nettie repeated her question, her voice catching in the sob that would
come despite her best efforts. With the going of both Cyril and her
mistress she felt deserted and forlorn.</p>

<p>"Will she be gone long I asked you?"</p>

<p>"Long enough to suit me," said the Bull slowly. "She's took a holiday.
Guess she's entitled to one now we've got a gell like you to take her
place up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> house. I'm thinking you'll fill the bill fine and suit
me down to a double T. Is supper ready?"</p>

<p>She stared up at him through the haze before her eyes, piteously, her
lips moving, almost as if entreating him. She tried to say:</p>

<p>"It'll be on the table in a few minutes," but the words came
indistinctly through the tears which now began to fall heavily in
spite of her effort to restrain them. Blindly she moved toward the
house, holding her apron to her face. Absorbed in her grief, she was
unconscious of the fact that the Bull pressed close to her side and
that it was his big hand under her arm that guided her to the house.
Inside the kitchen he held her for a space as she gasped and cried:</p>

<p>"I won't stay here alone."</p>

<p>"Yer don't have to, gell," said the Bull huskily. "I'm here."</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>She wrenched her arm free.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to stay in this house alone with <i>you</i>!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Ain't you? Mebbe you'd prefer the bunkhouses then?"</p>

<p>The Bull was chuckling coarsely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't stay nowhere at Bar Q. I'm goin' to get out&mdash;tonight."</p>

<p>"As you say, gell. I told the wife not to set too much store by you,
but no, she'd have her way. Said you could take her place and do the
work fine, and she thought she should do as the doctor said and git
away for a change."</p>

<p>Nettie paused, the thought of her mistress's confidence in her holding
her in her headlong purpose to escape.</p>

<p>"So I could do the work alone. It's not that. It's just that&mdash;that I'm
afraid to be here alone&mdash;with you," she blurted out.</p>

<p>"Far's that goes, I'm hikin' for Barstairs myself tonight. Goin' on up
to the Bull camp. We're leavin' for the States shortly, and I got to go
alone."</p>

<p>Something was burning on the stove and she rushed to lift off the
potatoes. The Bull had seated himself at the table and was buttering
a chunk of bread. Nettie hesitated a moment and then, as the man
apparently oblivious of or indifferent to her presence continued to
munch in abstracted silence, Nettie took her place at the table. She
poured out the tea and passed his cup to him, helping herself to a
piece of the cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> roast pork. The potato dish was to the left of him
and after a moment she timidly asked him to pass it to her. He shoved
the dish across without looking up and continued to "pack down"&mdash;an
expression of his own&mdash;the food.</p>

<p>The meal came to an end in this strange silence and afterwards she
cleared the table and washed the dishes, acutely aware of every move
the man made in the big room. He had taken down his sheepskin riding
coat and pushed his legs into fur chapps. The spurs clanked as he
snapped them onto his heels. He took down the quirt and huge hat
hanging to a deer head's horns, clapped the hat upon his head, and
tramped to the door. All his preparations indicated a long ride. At the
door he threw back an order to Nettie.</p>

<p>"Anyone telephones, I'll reach Barstairs by six or seven in the
mornin'. They can get me there. Have Jake at the house for chores. Let
'im sleep off the kitchen."</p>

<p>She nodded dumbly, conscious only of a vast sense of relief. He was
gone.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>Never had the ranch house seemed so large or so empty. A wave of
homesickness overwhelmed the lonely girl, a terrible longing to see her
little brothers and sisters, now so widely scattered about the country,
and be with them once again.</p>

<p>The days were gradually shortening and when the light faded about ten
o'clock darkness closed silently in upon the hill country. Though the
days were sunny the nights were very quiet and somewhat chilly.</p>

<p>Nettie Day knelt by her window. She could see the lights in the row of
bunkhouses and someone moving about the corrals with a lantern in his
hand. How long she knelt by her window she could not have said, but she
felt no inclination for sleep and put off preparing for bed as long as
possible.</p>

<p>The vast silence of the hills seemed to press down about the place and
in the utter stillness of the night the low wailing of a hungry coyote
in the hills awakened weird echoes. A healthy, placid girl, nerves had
never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> troubled Nettie; yet on that night she experienced a psychic
premonition of disaster, and when the depression weighed unbearably
down upon her she called to Jake from her window.</p>

<p>Stick on shoulder, the breed came from the kitchen door and grinned up
at her in the dusk. Jake was in one of his periods of delusions and
as sentry before an Indian war camp he patrolled fearlessly but with
catlike caution. His mere presence, however, comforted her, but her
cheek blanched as the breed returned to the house, gave a startled
cry&mdash;the cry of a man struck suddenly. She said to herself:</p>

<p>"Jake's playing! I guess he's shootin' at himself with his old arrows.
My, he's a queer one."</p>

<p>Long since the twinkling lights in the bunkhouses had disappeared one
by one as the men "turned in." The "hands" of the Bar Q were early
risers and "hit the bunks" as soon as the light left the sky.</p>

<p>The last sign of life had vanished. Even the coyote was silent and the
darkness grew ever deeper.</p>

<p>Nettie turned from her window at last. Her long plaits of hair hung
down, like a Marguerite's, on her shoulders. In her white night dress
she looked very virginal and sweet. She had raised her hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> begun
to coil up the golden braids when something&mdash;a stealthy, cautious
motion&mdash;caused her to pause. She stood still in the middle of the room,
her eyes wide and startled, staring at the door.</p>

<p>The bureau stood by the door and a lamp burned on it. Slowly the knob
turned and she felt something push against the frail door which she
had, however, locked.</p>

<p>Though well-nigh paralyzed with fear she found strength to seize her
one chair and thrust its back underneath the knob so that its two back
legs firmly on the floor might help the now loudly cracking door to
resist the force that was slowly pushing it in. She blew out the light
and retreated towards the window.</p>

<p>There was the sound of snapping steel and the lock was burst. The
upturned chair quivered on its two back feet, held sturdily in place a
moment and then splintered under the iron strength of the man without.</p>

<p>As the door gave way a numbness came upon her and, without power to
move, like some fascinated thing, she watched the approach of the Bull.
She knew that she was trapped and clutching her throat with both hands
she tried to force to her lips the cry that would not come.</p>

<p>She was in a black dream, a merciless nightmare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>She awoke, screaming wildly:</p>

<p>"Cyril, Cyril, Cyril! Cyril! <i>Cyril!</i>" and over and over again, "Cyril!"</p>

<p>Like one gone stark mad she groped her way to the window and threw
herself out.</p>

<p>When she regained consciousness the bright, hard sun was in her eyes.
She stared up at a brilliant blue sky. Jake knelt on the grass beside
her and tried to move her to the shadow of the house. She moaned:</p>

<p>"Leave me be. I want to die."</p>

<p>Jake muttered excitedly:</p>

<p>"Him! Him! Him see&mdash;him hurt Nettie. Last night him hurt Jake bad."</p>

<p>"Him!" She knew whom Jake meant by "him" and threw up her arm as if to
shield herself from a blow. At that moment his shadow loomed above her
and she cowered and cringed from it.</p>

<p>"How'd you git here?" He looked up at the window. "You got to cut out
this damn nonsense. I ain't aimin' to hurt you, but you can't lay out
here. Here, I'll carry you into the house. Keep still, will yer? D'you
want me to tie you?"</p>

<p>Her struggles ceased. Eyes closed, she submitted limply as he lifted
her in his arms and carried her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> the house. Jake followed, wringing
his hands and whimpering like a dog.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, holding to the bannisters, she managed to limp
downstairs. For a long time she sat on the hard kitchen chair, staring
with unseeing eyes before her. Even when she heard the heavy tramp of
the Bull's feet on the outside porch she did not raise her head and as
he came in her hopeless gaze remained still fixed on space.</p>

<p>"Hello! Whatchu doin' down here? How'd you get down here?"</p>

<p>"I come down myself," said Nettie listlessly. "My ankle ain't hurtin'
me no more."</p>

<p>"I'd a' carried you down if you asked me," he grunted angrily. "I done
everything a man could for a girl. Who's been waiting on you hand and
foot these last four days just's if you was a delicate lady instead of
a hired girl on a ranch. What more d'you want? The more you do for some
folks the more they want."</p>

<p>Nettie said nothing, but two great tears suddenly rolled out of her
eyes and splashed slowly down her cheeks. She resented those tears&mdash;a
sign of weakness, where she felt hard and frozen within, and she
peevishly brushed them away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"What you cryin' about?"</p>

<p>"I jus' want that you should let me alone," said Nettie.</p>

<p>"You'll be let alone soon enough now. I got to go to Barstairs, and I
got to go on to the States. We're billed up at the fairs over there,
and I got to go along with my bulls. I'd take you with me if it wasn't
for that young buck at Barstairs. I ain't plannin' on sharing you with
no one, do you get me? You belong to Bull Langdon. I got you at the
sale, same's I got the rest of your dad's old truck, and what the Bull
gets his hands on he keeps. It's up to yourself how you git treated.
I'm free handed with them that treats me right. My old woman ain't
strong. She'll croak one of these days and 'twon't be long before
they'll be another Mrs. Langdon at Bar Q. You treat the Bull right and
you'll be the second Mrs. Langdon."</p>

<p>Nettie twisted her hands in her apron. Her heart ached dully and at the
mention of her mistress's name a fierce lump rose persistently in her
throat.</p>

<p>"Well, what you got to say to that?"</p>

<p>She did not answer and he pursued wrathfully:</p>

<p>"You're sulking now and you're sore on me, but you'll get over that,
gell. I'll knock it out of your <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>system damn soon if you don't, and
you'll find out that it'll pay you to be on the right side of the Bull
rather than the wrong."</p>

<p>"I ain't aiming to make you mad," said Nettie piteously, shrinking
under the implied threat. He chuckled, relishing his power.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be off. If it weren't for them bulls nothing could take me
from you now, gell, but I ain't fool enough to neglect my <i>bulls</i> for a
gell. I'm goin' along with the herd far as St. Louis, and I'll be back
to you before the month is out."</p>

<p>His big lips closed over hers. The loathsome embrace seemed to strangle
her. Then she was alone again.</p>

<p>She sat in the kitchen for more than an hour after the departure of the
Bull, still in that attitude of stupefied apathy, then limped upstairs,
into her room, closed the battered door, and sat down on the edge of
her bed, holding her head in her hands. She had no feeling save that
of intense weariness and dead despair. Presently, still dressed, she
fell sideways upon the bed and slept the long, unbroken sleep of one
physically and mentally exhausted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>Part of journal kept by Lady Angella Loring: I hate men and despise
women. I am afraid of children. Animals are my only friends.</p>

<p>I'm not pretty. My face is hard, my hair&mdash;what is left of it&mdash;of no
color. My hands are calloused. I am a "tough old nut" as once I heard a
"hand" of the Bar Q describe me. I wear men's clothes because they are
comfortable and because I want to forget that I am a woman.</p>

<p>My father was the victim of a swindler, a smiling-faced, lying-tongued
scoundrel, who robbed him of all we possessed in the world. The man I
was to have married was as surely my father's murderer as if he had
held the hand that sent the shot through my father's brain that killed
him. I am the last of the Lorings, I&mdash;the poor old man-maid recluse, on
the edge of Yankee Valley in the Canadian Northwest.</p>

<p>This bit of Alberta land is all that is left of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> once vast Loring
estate. That I still have this is due purely to the accident of a groom
paying back a debt he owed my father. It was strange that I should
have learned of its existence at a time when I believed that the end
had come for me even as it had come for my father. True, I was not to
go out of life by the act of my own hand and will. A quite eminent
scientist had pronounced my death sentence. He gave me a few months in
which to live. It was a ghastly situation for one who had been through
what I had and who desired to live for the noble purpose of revenge.
That sounds melodramatic and I suppose if I were pious I would hear in
mind that revenge is sweet only for God. But my nature is not sweet and
hell raged within me at that time. It was strange, as I have said, at
that time suddenly to learn of the existence of this ranch. I seemed
to see it as in a dream&mdash;it lay far off under a spotlight of Alberta
sunlight and it called to me with a clarion call.</p>

<p>I came out here. I am hard and strong. I don't intend to die. I've
something to live for. Not a <i>man</i>. I hate men, as I have said above. I
have deep-rooted, never-dying aversion for the whole mean race of men.
That which I have to live for is this quarter section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> of Alberta land.
It's <i>mine</i>. I love it better than anything else on earth.</p>

<p>I broke my own land. I've put in my own crop. I hayed and chored,
fenced and drudged, both in house and upon the land. I made most of my
own furniture and I practically rebuilt the inside of this old shack.</p>

<p>"Necessity is the mother of invention" goes the proverb, but I loathe
proverbs. One can find an opposing one for even the best of them. Some
people pin proverbs and poems and texts upon their souls as on their
walls. I suppose they get the sort of comfort and help from it that a
cripple gets from a crutch. As far as that goes we are all cripples in
life, and few there be who can walk without a crutch. I never saw a
human being yet who did not limp, at least mentally....</p>

<p>There's one man in Alberta who comes to see me regularly once a month
and no snub or plain telling that I prefer my own company to that of
any others makes any impression upon him. He is painfully, hopelessly
Scotch. However, one cannot quarrel with a man who has saved one's
life. I am, or was, what they call in the west a "lunger." I was
definitely diagnosed as "T.B." But if any one doubts that my lungs are
sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> now they should hear me let out a war whoop that would compare
well with old Chief Pie Belly's. Pie Belly is a Stony Indian and I have
learned some things of that Indian. Not that I make a daily practice of
war whooping, but there's sport in letting the full volume and force
of one's lungs pour out across the utter silence of the prairie. If my
voice carries to my neighbors&mdash;the nearest is five miles off&mdash;no doubt
they take me for a coyote.</p>

<p>That Scotch doctor likes to pick a quarrel, to argue, to find fault and
to bark like a dog. Alberta, according to him, is a "mon's land." There
is no sentimental reference to "God's country" or "Sunny Alberta" from
him. It is a hard land&mdash;a mon's land. I've no right here. I should not
work outside the house. I should engage a couple to work the place on
shares. I should dress as a "lass"; I should permit my hair to grow
"as God planted it"; I should chasten my bitter tongue and heart; I
should cultivate my neighbors, and I should not set myself up against
my fellow men. Hm! Sounds very fine, my Scotch friend, but what do you
know of what I have been through? How can you know that I am frozen
inside?</p>

<p>My ranch&mdash;and I would rather write of my ranch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> than dig into my
personal thoughts and emotions&mdash;if there are any left in me&mdash;my ranch
lies midway between the good grain lands on one side and the hill
country, the cattle lands, on the other. I suppose I am part of Yankee
Valley. I am sorry for that because I do not like Americans. They are
noisy, insincere, and a boasting, bragging lot. As far as that goes, I
like the English less. The Scotch are hard to tolerate, and as for the
Irish, the devil made them in his own likeness. If it comes down to
that, I don't know a single nationality that I can respect, and I have
lived all over the world.</p>

<p>To farm is to gamble on the largest scale possible, for the earth may
be said to be our board, the seed our dice and the elements, the soil,
the parasites, the hail, the frost and the drought, these are the cards
stacked against us. But, like all gamblers, we are reaching out for a
prize that enthralls and lures us, and that "pot of gold at the end of
our rainbow" is the harvest&mdash;the wonderful, glorious golden harvest of
Alberta. Some day, it will come to me also.</p>

<p>In the spring, our land is excessively fragrant. The black, loamy soil
fairly calls to one to lay the seed within its fertile bosom. Anything
will grow in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>Alberta. It's a thrilling sight to see the grain prick up
sturdy and strong. When first my own showed its green head above the
earth, I suffered such exhilaration that I could have thrown myself
upon the ground, and kissed the good earth. Those tiny points of green,
there on the soil that I myself had plowed, disked, harrowed and
seeded. I suffered the exquisite pang of the creator.</p>

<p>If only one might shut up memories in a box, close the lid tight
and turn the key upon them. If but the past could be blotted out,
as are our sins by death, then, methinks, we would find comfort and
compensation in this poor life once again.</p>

<p>The last generation of the Lorings were a soft-handed, dependent race.
I come of an older, primitive breed, I am a reversion to type, for I
love to labor with my hands. Had I been a man, I might have been a
ditch or a grave digger. I love the earth. When I die, I do not want to
be cremated. I want to go back to the soil.</p>

<p>I talk here of compensations and of my ranch which I say is what I have
to live for, yet life has not been sweet or easy for me in Alberta.
It's been a battle with a grim antagonist&mdash;for poverty and sickness
and cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>&mdash;what can be grimmer than these? And then, much as I love to
put in my crop, I have not yet had the joy of reaping it, for cutworm
took my first, and this year early frost destroyed my grain when it had
attained almost full growth. But never mind&mdash;that is all part of the
game. The hardest part has been the enforced work at the Bar Q. No one
enjoys laboring for those beneath them. I don't mean the laboring men.
I have no sense of caste whatsoever, and they are as good as I am, I
suppose. But Bull Langdon, the man whose pay I must take. He is a wild
beast, one of the two legged cattle that should go to the shambles with
his stock.</p>

<p>Yet I am not afraid of Bull Langdon. He never shouts at me. He only
blusters, and his bloodshot eyes fall before mine. He may be the great
boss and bully of the Bar Q. With his big bull whip in hand, his
cattle may cower before him, and his men quail and slink away; his
wife and Jake may tremble at the sound of his voice or step. <i>I</i> have
his "number." I know that he is a coward, a great sneaking bully. He
can lord it over small men and women and half-witted Indian boys. He
never employs stronger or bigger men than himself. A giant in stature,
and a Samson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> in strength, nevertheless I assert he is a coward, a big
unwhipped bully, whose own strength will some day prove his boomerang.</p>

<p>It's queer, as I have run along, I have omitted all mention of one in
Alberta whom I should call a friend. Just a poor, illiterate young
girl. I never can forget Nettie Day as I first saw her. Sickness,
delirium even, may cast a glamour over things. It may be then our
imagination pictures things as they are not; but nevertheless, Nettie's
face, bending above my own, with its gentle look of tenderness and
compassion, seemed to me as sweet as the "blessed damozel's" as she
looked down from heaven to the earth beneath. She had wide, deep blue
eyes, a child's eyes, full of an unplumbed innocence and questioning.
Strange how one can come into our lives for such a little spell,
disappear beyond our sight, and still remain in our hearts. I have seen
little enough of Nettie, and the last time I saw her I hate to recall
that I scolded her.</p>

<p>Next to my place is a quarter section of homestead land, owned by a
young man named Stanley. One day I was fencing, when this young fellow,
who had made attempts upon several occasions to speak to me, came over
and watched me at my work. I ignored him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> like my doctor friend,
above mentioned, he is Scotch and thick. He didn't even know he was
being ignored, and presently in a disgustingly friendly way he had the
colossal nerve to attempt to instruct me in the art of making post
holes. At that juncture I turned around and looked at him. Now I may
seem as that Bar Q hand said, like a "tough old nut." No doubt I look
like one, but I know the English trick of freezing ordinary people
by a mere look. It <i>is</i> a trick, like the Englishman's monocle and
the strange part is only an English person can do it. You just stare,
stonily, at the insignificant atom before you. I begin at the feet,
and travel contemptuously up the whole despised body, till I reach
the abashed and propitiating face. One need not say a single word.
That look&mdash;if you know the technique of the act&mdash;is enough. This young
Stanley dropped his hammer in a hurry and turned very red.</p>

<p>"I say, you're not mad at me, are you?" he stammered.</p>

<p>And just then Nettie, whom the doctor had dropped at my house that day,
came from out the house, and something about that boy's face, just a
flicker of the eye and the deepening red about his ears apprised me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of the reason why he was so keen on being friends with me. I turned
just in time to see on Nettie's guilty face the identical flicker I had
noted on Stanley's. As cross as two sticks, I grabbed that girl by the
arm and shoved her along the field to the house.</p>

<p>Once inside, I made her sit down, while I told her in detail all of
the miseries and pitfalls and deceits and heartbreaks, the general
unhappiness that befalls one foolish enough to fall in love. Love I
told her was an antiquated emotion which had been burned out by the
force of its own mad fire. I said something like that, for I was
talking with feeling, upon a topic I understood, and as I talked,
becoming more and more moved and excited as my subject warmed me,
suddenly I observed that Nettie's eyes were fixed on space, as if on
something very far away. She had her large, white hands unconsciously
clasped upon her bosom; she was kneeling beside me, and something
about her pose struck me at that moment as so divinely beautiful, so
exquisitely madonna-like and lovely, that I choked upon my words and
could go no further.</p>

<p>Then Nettie came out of her dream&mdash;I am sure she had heard not a word
of my discourse&mdash;and said:</p>

<p>"Thank you, Angel." That girl calls me&mdash;Angel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> God alone knows why.
There is little of the angel in me.</p>

<p>I have not seen her since that day. Life has played strange tricks upon
my little friend since then. Her father dead, her brothers and sisters
scattered about in institutions and on farms, Nettie herself&mdash;at the
Bar Q&mdash;of all places in the world, the last I would have wished to have
seen her go!</p>

<p>Sometimes in the evening, when my work is done, I can recall to my mind
Nettie as I last saw her with almost photographic clearness, and I
experience a sense of nearness to her. The other night I had an impulse
to start out then and there for the Bar Q. I felt that she needed me.</p>

<p>That young man on the adjoining quarter section sings a great deal as
he works. I can hear him clear across the field&mdash;he has a real voice,
a full, fine baritone, and in the still evenings, I confess there is
something uplifting about that fresh young voice as it rings across the
prairie. His home is nearing completion, he says, and that is why he
sings. The thought of home and Nettie warms his heart till it bursts
into song. Ah&mdash;well, who am I to judge what is best for these young
people? So, sing on, young Cyril. I hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> that that clear brave voice
of yours, as full of melody as a lark's, will never falter.</p>

<p>Last night, when I came in from the field, the half-breed Jake sidled
along from behind my house. It gave me a start to see the poor idiot
with his wild, witless face. He wanted to tell me something about the
Bar Q. He jabbered and gibbered, and I could hardly make head or tail
of what he was saying, save that Bull Langdon was eating something up.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>Bright sunlight flooded Alberta. The miraculous harvest was over, and
the buzz of the thousand threshing machines, day and night, sounded
like music in the ears of the ranchers. The greatest bumper crop in the
history of the continent had made Alberta famous throughout the grain
world.</p>

<p>Settlers were pouring in from across the line. Land values soared to
preposterous heights; and wherever there were municipalities of open
range and unbroken land, the territory was being staked and fenced.</p>

<p>On the heels of the famous crop came first the fatal oil and then the
fatal city real estate boom, which later was to act as a boomerang
to the land, since it brought in the wildcat speculator, the
get-rich-quick folk, the gold-brick seller and the train of clever
swindlers that spring up from nowhere when a boom is on. The great
province was to be exploited by these parasites. The boom swelled to
fabulous proportions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> almost overnight. The streets of Calgary were
thronged, train loads poured into the country; hysterical, half-crazed
gamblers and "suckers" made or lost fortunes overnight; businesses of
all kinds were started on "a shoe-string"; the wildest stories of oil
flowing like water raced about the land. Oil indeed there was, as also
coal in unlimited quantities, for the mineral wealth of the province
had barely been scratched, but the boom was in full swing before the
tests had been properly made, with the result that conservative people
began to regard it askance, and almost as quickly as it had started,
like an inflated bubble the oil boom burst. This brought undeserved
desertion and wholesale ruin upon the country. Alberta had been made
the "goat" of a flock of get-rich-folk from across the line, intent on
making fortunes which then existed only upon paper.</p>

<p>The one solid and substantial asset that all the deflated booms could
not affect, was the agricultural wealth of the province, real and
potential. During this period, Bull Langdon's power and wealth swelled
to enormous proportions. Before the year was out, he had become a
multimillionaire. His cattle ranged over those "thousand hills"; his
hundreds of granaries were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> overflowing with the grain of that bumper
crop, grain that he held to sell as soon as the market was right; his
grip was upon the stockyards and packing house industry and the stock
market was under his control. No one questioned his right to be called
the Cattle King of Canada.</p>

<p>Bloated with affluence and power, illiterate and uncouth as ever, his
vanity was boundless. It flattered him to be known as the richest and
most powerful man in the Province; to have his cattle, his stock, his
immense ranches pointed out; to see his brand far-flung over the cattle
country, and encroaching into the western States; his name stamped
upon the beef that topped the market, not merely in the east but in
the west, even into the Chicago stockyards&mdash;there to be exhibited,
and wondered at&mdash;grass fed steers, competing with and surpassing the
cornfeds of the U.S.A.</p>

<p>Above all his possessions he placed his magnificent purebred Hereford
bulls, a race whose stamp was upon the whole cattle country, for
scarcely a farmer or rancher in the country, but aspired to have his
herd headed by a Bar Q bull. He had spared neither expense nor labor
upon the breeding of these perfect animals, whose sires had come from
the most famous herds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> England and the States, and whose mothers
were pure Canadian stock.</p>

<p>He coveted now the world championship for his latest product, a
two-year-old Hereford bull, Prince Perfection Bar Q the Fourth. The
Prince, as he was known throughout the purebred world, was of royal
ancestry, and already, as a mere calf, his career at the cattle fairs
in Canada had brought him under the eyes of the experts and cattle
specialists. He was the son of that Princess Perfection Bar Q the
Third, who had brought the lordly price when exhibited by Bull Langdon
in Chicago of $40,000. His sire was of foreign birth, shipped to Canada
by a member of the royal family, who, infatuated with the "cattle
game," had acquired a ranch in Canada, and declared it to be the sport
of kings.</p>

<p>Annually there was a showing of the Bar Q bulls, and from far and near
ranchers and farmers trekked from all over Canada and the States to
see the latest products of the famous herd. This year was exceptional,
inasmuch, as the two-year-old Prince was to be examined and shown
before a jury of experts, who would pronounce upon his chances of
winning the coveted championship in the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>His curly hide brushed and smoothed, oiled and trimmed; his hoofs all
but manicured; his face washed with soft oiled cloths; his eyes and
nostrils wiped with boracic acid solution; fed on the choicest of green
feed and chop, a golden ring in his nose, through which a golden chain
was passed, the petted brute was led out to gladden the eyes of stock
enthusiasts, experts, agriculturists, scientific cattle students, and
others connected with the purebred game, who had come literally from
the four corners of the earth, with a passion similar to that of the
scientist or the collector, discovering some coveted rare specimen.
They crowded about this perfect product of the Hereford race, and
looked the massive brute over with the eyes of connoisseurs.</p>

<p>In that crowd of men about the roped-in space, around which Cyril
Stanley led the bull by the chain, university men, men of title, an
English Prince and an ex-president of the U.S.A., millionaire cattlemen
and sportsmen, the overall cattlemen, ranchers, farmers, stock
enthusiasts, stockyard and packing-house men, to say nothing of the
humble homesteaders and derelicts, the numerous "remittancemen" from
the old country, and speculators from cattle centers in Canada and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the States. A mixed "bunch," socially as wide apart as the poles, but
in that cattle shed as close as brothers. They rubbed elbows, swapped
expensive cigars for grimy chews, held their sides at each other's
jokes, and joshed and roared across to each other. They were kindred
spirits, and cattle was the bond between them.</p>

<p>Glowering and grinning at each other, as at a prize fight, applauding,
groaning out oaths of enthusiasm, strange explosive utterances, they
were a motley company. Professor Morton Calhoun made a circle of his
hands, and squinted through it with one screwed-up eye, the attitude of
an artist before a masterpiece, and after a long scrutiny, shook his
head and groaned with joy.</p>

<p>Through this group of men moved Bull Langdon, in high good humor,
dominant and arrogant, intimate with everyone, yet close to no one.
When the big shed was full, and the circle about the ropes entirely
surrounded his exhibit, Bull Langdon nonchalantly stepped into the
ring, where the Prince followed Cyril Stanley tamely about. Cyril had a
curiously hypnotic influence over the animal, and could even make him
submit to having his head caressed and his nose patted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>On either horn two bright ribbons had been coyly twisted and tied,
and these gave the animal a peculiarly festive look. As Bull Langdon
stepped into the ring, a murmur of admiring and respectful applause
broke forth. He approached the Prince from the left side, and reaching
out a careless hand pulled the ribbon from one of the horns.</p>

<p>"We ain't raisin' no dolls!" said the cowman. "This is a <i>Bull</i>!" and
he reached for the other horn.</p>

<p>"Careful, boss!" warned Cyril. "He's not used to all this excitement,
and I got my hands full keeping him calm."</p>

<p>"Who's talking?" growled the cattleman, spitting with amusement. "Are
you trying to teach Bull Langdon the cattle game, you young whelp? I
knowed it before the day you was born."</p>

<p>The young bull's head had suddenly uplifted. He sniffed the air, his
neck bristling. Slowly, growing in depth and power, there burst from
his throat a mighty roar that shook the tent, and drove the color from
the faces about that ring, as with an almost concerted movement there
was a backing from the lines and an exodus from the tent. Bull Langdon,
as swiftly as a cat, had backed to the lines and was over them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> Cyril
was alone in the inclosure with the roaring bull. Half talking, half
singing, not for a moment did his hand relax its grip upon the chain.
Slowly the animal's head turned in his direction and again dropped
submissively. There was a breath of relief about the lines, and Cyril
led the bull back to his stall, fastening him securely to his post by
the ring in his nose.</p>

<p>Bull Langdon was swearing foully, but his fury against Cyril and the
Prince subsided at the approach of Professor Calhoun, the greatest
authority on pure bred cattle in the world.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the little man, glaring at Bull Langdon through
double-lensed glasses, scrutinizing the cattleman with the scientific
air with which he examined cattle, "I will not hesitate to predict that
your animal's progress throughout the United States&mdash;I will go farther
and say, throughout the world&mdash;will be one of unbroken triumph. It has
been my pleasure to look upon the most perfect Hereford specimen in the
world. I congratulate you, sir."</p>

<p>Bull Langdon grunted, rose on the balls of his feet, chewed on the plug
in his cheek, spat, and, his chest swelling, roared across at one of
the Bar Q "hands."</p>

<p>"Take the gentleman&mdash;take all of the gentlemen&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> he added, with a
sweeping gesture of his arm toward the crowd, "to the booze tent. The
treat's on Bull Langdon. Fill up, gentlemen, on the Bar Q."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, satiated with gloating over his great treasure, he bethought
of another possession and upon which at this stage he set if possible
an even greater value. True, he reckoned Nettie as "scrub" stock, while
the Prince was of lordly lineage. On the auction block, the prince
might bring a price that was worth a king's ransom; yet as he thought
of the big, white-skinned, blue-eyed girl, the cowman knew that he
would not give her up for all the champions in the cattle world. He
owned the Prince; but though he had held the girl in his arms, he knew
in his heart of hearts that she had never been his. That was what
fretted and tormented him&mdash;the thought that his brand upon Nettie could
never be permanent.</p>

<p>It was a boast of the cowman that what he wanted he took, and what he
took, he held. He had wanted Nettie Day. He had taken her by mad force,
as a barbarian might have fallen upon a Christian slave, yet he knew,
with a sense of smoldering hatred and fury that a single hair upon the
head of the young Bar Q hand was more to her than the Bull and all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>possessions. He was torn with a desire to return to Bar Q, and again
take forcible possession of the girl; but the prize herd was now almost
ready for the tour. It would be disastrous, ruinous to his reputation
and career, if, at this psychological moment, anything should interfere
with the departure of the herd, and there was no man in the outfit who
could be trusted to take the place of Bull Langdon himself. Well, it
would be the matter of a month or two only, and he would be back.</p>

<p>He found himself at the Prince's stall, glowering down upon the back
of the kneeling Cyril, who was brushing down his charge's legs with an
oiled brush. Presently Cyril looked up, and seeing his employer, he
arose. The Bull cleared his throat noisily.</p>

<p>"Well, how about it, bo? You goin' along with Prince to the States?"</p>

<p>Cyril waited in his slow way, before replying, and as he hesitated, the
Bull threw in savagely:</p>

<p>"Bonus of $500 to the 'hand' that takes special charge of the Prince
and another $10 raise to his wages."</p>

<p>$500! It was a mighty sum of money, and the young man felt his heart
thump at the thought of what it would buy for Nettie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"When would you want me to leave?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks."</p>

<p>"When'd we be back?"</p>

<p>"Two months. I'll go along as far as St. Louis; leave for a spell, and
join you at Chicago, comin' back with the outfit."</p>

<p>"I'd want a week off."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I got a bit of fencing to finish on my homestead, and I got to ride
over to Bar Q."</p>

<p>"What you want at Bar Q?"</p>

<p>Cyril's straight glance met his.</p>

<p>"My girl's there."</p>

<p>"Who'd you mean?"</p>

<p>"Nettie Day. We're planning to get married this winter."</p>

<p>The savage in Bull Langdon was barely held in check. He could scarcely
control the impulse to throttle the life out of this cool-eyed youth,
who dared to claim for his own what was the Bull's.</p>

<p>"You're countin' your chickens before they're hatched, ain't you?" he
snarled. "Mebbe the gell's stuck on someone else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not on your life she's not," said Cyril with calm conviction. "She and
me are promised."</p>

<p>"Beat it, then," roared the Bull, "and the sooner you're back, the
sooner we'll start. I'll hold the job for you for two weeks&mdash;not a day
longer."</p>

<p>"You can count on me," said Cyril. "I'll be on the job."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>Every day Nettie arose at six and went about her dull duties. There
was the cream to separate, the pails and separator to clean and scald;
there was the butter to make; the chickens to feed, washing, ironing
and cleaning. The canning season was at hand and the Indians rode in
with wild cranberries, gooseberries, raspberries and saskatoons. From
day to day she picked over and washed the fruit, packed it in syrup in
jars, and set them in the wash boiler on the range.</p>

<p>Time accustoms us even to suffering, and one of the penalties of
youth and health is that one thrives and lives and pursues one's way,
even though the heart within one be dead. Vaguely Nettie groped for
a solution to her tragedy. She knew that it was not something that
could be pushed away into some recess of the mind; it was something
unforgettable, a scar upon the soul rather than the body. Of Cyril she
could think only with the most intense anguish of mind, and knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> that
she could never face the man she loved and tell him what had befallen
her. Already he had come to exist in her mind only as a loved one dead.
He was no longer for her. She had lost Cyril through this act of Bull
Langdon.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the departure of the Bull for the purebred camp, Nettie
was startled at her work by the insistent ringing of the telephone,
which had been unusually silent since then. Her first thought was that
the Bull was calling from Barstairs, and the thought of his hated
voice, even upon the wire, held her back. The telephone repeated its
ring, and with lagging feet Nettie at last answered it.</p>

<p>"Hello!"</p>

<p>"Is that the Bar Q?"</p>

<p>It was a woman's voice, quavering and friendly. Nettie's hand tightened
in a vise about the receiver. Her eyes closed. Pale as death, she
leaned against the wall.</p>

<p>"Is that Bar Q? Is that you, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Langdon home?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Any of the men about?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're all in the fields."</p>

<p>"That's too bad. I'm here at the station. Came down on the noon train.
'Twould take too long for you to harness up and meet me, so I'll go
over to the Reserve, and maybe Mr. Barrons will bring me up. Good-by,
Nettie. Is everything all right?"</p>

<p>A pause, and then Nettie answered faintly:</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>Nettie hung up the 'phone, and stood with her face pressed to the wall.
A great tide of fear and shame swept over her. How was she to face her
gentle mistress? How speak to her? How find words to tell her? She
longed to escape from the kind and questioning eyes that would look so
trustingly and fondly into her own.</p>

<p>It was but half an hour's run by automobile from the station, and the
grating noise of the car, valorously trying to make the high grade to
the house, brought Nettie violently back to life. She dabbed at her
eyes with her apron, smoothed her hair and tried to compose herself as
best she could as the little car chugged to the back door.</p>

<p>An appalling change had taken place in Mrs. Langdon. Despite her feeble
protest, the Indian agent, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> whose car she had come, insisted upon
lifting the frail little woman from the automobile, and carrying her
into the house. She tried to laugh, as Nettie placed a chair for her,
and when her breath would permit it, she said bravely:</p>

<p>"Well, here I am, Nettie, back like a bad penny, and feeling just fine!"</p>

<p>Fine! When there was scarcely anything left of her but skin and bones.
Fine! When she was so weak she could scarcely stand without holding
on to something. Nettie knelt in a passion of mothering pity beside
her, and removed the little woman's coat and hat. Meanwhile, the faint
tinkle of her mistress's chiding laughter hurt Nettie more than if she
had struck her.</p>

<p>"Why, Nettie, one would think I was a baby the way you are fussing over
me. I really feel <i>very</i> well. I'm in perfect health. We all are, dear,
you know. Illness is just an error of the imagination, just as sin and
everything that is ugly and cruel in the world is. We are all perfect,
made in God's image, and we can be what we will. Why, Nettie, dear,
what on earth&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Nettie's head had fallen upon her mistress's lap, great sobs rending
her.</p>

<p>"Nettie! Nettie! I'm real cross with you. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> won't do at all.
Don't you see that by giving way like this, we bring on our illnesses
and troubles? We really are manufacturers of our own ills, and the
solutions of all our problems are right within ourselves."</p>

<p>Nettie raised her head dumbly at that, and tried to choke back the
overwhelming sobs.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Langdon, I can't never leave you now."</p>

<p>"Never leave me! Were you thinking of going, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Mrs. Langdon. I thought I'd <i>have</i> to go. There&mdash;were reasons
why, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nettie, if the reasons are&mdash;Cyril, why, I know all about it. You can't
possibly marry anyway until he gets back. Bill wants him to go to the
States with the bulls."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Langdon, I can't never marry Cyril Stanley. I'd die first. Oh,
Mrs. Langdon, I wisht I was dead. I wisht I had the nerve to drown
myself in the Ghost River."</p>

<p>"Nettie Day, that is downright wicked. Whatever's come over you? Have
you fallen out with Cyril? You've been brooding here alone. Now I'm
back, things will right themselves. I want you to be the cheerful girl
I'm so fond of&mdash;so very fond of, Nettie."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Very slowly, but bravely waving back the help Nettie proffered with
outstretched hand, Mrs. Langdon moved to the stairs, smiling and
reiterating softly her health formula:</p>

<p>"I am strong; in perfect health; in God's image; His creation. All's
well with me and God's good world."</p>

<p>Nettie watched her as slowly she climbed the stairs. There was the
sound of a closing door, and then a hollow, wrenching, barking cough.
Words of the Bull flashed like lightning across Nettie's mind:</p>

<p>"My old woman ain't strong. She'll croak soon. There'll be another Mrs.
Langdon at Bar Q. You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nettie's hand went to her strangling throat. Her voice rang out through
the room in wild despair:</p>

<p>"Oh, my <i>God</i>!" prayed Nettie Day. "Don't let Mrs. Langdon die. Don't
let her die. Please, please, please, oh, God! let her live!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>The long, golden fall of Alberta was especially beautiful that year,
and although well into November, the weather was as warm and sunny as
the month of May. Winter came late to Alberta, sometimes withholding
its frosty hand till considerably after Christmas; but it stayed late,
extending even into the spring months. There was a popular saying that
there was no spring in Alberta; one stepped directly out of winter
into summer. But the Alberta fall was incomparably beautiful. The
days were laden with sunlight, and the night skies, with their myriad
stars, set in a firmament more beautiful than anywhere else on earth,
were remarkable for their lunar rainbows, and the white blaze of the
Northern lights.</p>

<p>Yet the long, sunlit days, and the cool, starry nights brought no balm
to the distracted Nettie. She felt undone&mdash;body and soul.</p>

<p>As she trailed listlessly across the barnyard, she no longer chirruped
happily to the wee chicks or reproved the contentious mother hens. All
joy in work and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> contact with the live things on the ranch was gone
for her. She lived on like a machine, automatically wound up. There
were certain daily duties to be done; she went about them dully and
mechanically.</p>

<p>One November evening as she came, basket in hand, out of the cowbarn,
where she had been looking for eggs in the stalls where the hens loved
to lay, Jake raced through the yard on his broncho, shouting and
screaming with excitement.</p>

<p>"Him! Him!" wildly yelled Jake, pointing toward where along the Banff
highway a solitary horseman could be seen. At the word "Him" Nettie's
first thought was of the Bull, and she stiffened and paled; but as she
looked down the slope, to where the rider was passing through the main
gate to the road, she turned even whiter, and longing and fear together
shook her so violently that she could hardly keep from swooning at
the sight of the well-remembered wide hat, the bright flowing scarf,
loosely tied beneath the boyish chin, the orange-colored chapps, and
the peppery young broncho bearing his rider now so swiftly up that
slope. She did not recover from her emotion in time to take flight, as
her terrified impulse urged her, for Jake had already opened the gate
of the corral, and Cyril passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> through. He had seen the girl at the
barn door, and leaping from his horse, was at her side in an instant.</p>

<p>The basket of eggs in her hand crashed to the ground. She lifted up
both her hands, and her eyes looked wildly about her like a trapped
thing, seeking some way of escape, as steadily, with face aglow, he
closed in upon her. With a muffled cry, she beat him back from her,
crying loudly:</p>

<p>"No-o! No! <i>No!</i>"</p>

<p>Like one possessed, she pushed him from her with mad strength and
rushed through the corral out into the yard. Dumfounded, Cyril looked
after her, and then calling her by name he pursued her.</p>

<p>"Nettie! Nettie! I say&mdash;Nettie!"</p>

<p>She fled as if demented, running in a circle around the house; then
darted in at the back kitchen door. She tried to hold the door closed,
but his impetuous hand forced it open. Her breath coming in spasmodic
gasps, leaning against the wall of the back kitchen for support, Nettie
faced him.</p>

<p>She cried out loudly:</p>

<p>"Go away! Go away!"</p>

<p>"Go away? What do you mean? What for? Nettie, for God's sake, what's
the matter, little girl?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>She repeated the words wildly, with all her force.</p>

<p>"Go away! Go! Don't come near me. Don't touch me. Don't even look at
me."</p>

<p>"Why not? What's the matter? You're playin' a game, and it ain't fair
to go so far. What's the matter, girl? Nettie&mdash;you&mdash;you ain't gone back
on me, are you?"</p>

<p>She could not meet those imploring young eyes, and turned bodily about,
so that now her face was to the wall, and her back to him. Her voice
sounded muffled, strangled:</p>

<p>"Leave me be. I mustn't see you."</p>

<p>"Why not? Since when? What've I done? I got a right to know. What's
happened?"</p>

<p>His voice quavered though he sought manfully to control it. There was a
long, tense silence, and then Nettie Day said in a low, dead voice:</p>

<p>"I ain't the same."</p>

<p>"You mean you've changed?" he demanded, and she answered in that same
lost voice:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;all changed. I ain't the same."</p>

<p>He took this in slowly, his hands clenching, the hot tears scalding his
lids. Then burst out with boyish anguish and passion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't say that, Nettie. I can't believe it. It ain't true. You and
me&mdash;we're promised. I been thinking of nothing else. I built the little
house for you. It's all ready now, dear, and I come on up to Bar Q now
to tell you I got a chance to go to the States with the purebred stuff,
and there's a bonus of $500 in it for me, and a $10 raise to my wages.
Nettie, girl, I took him up on that proposition, because I wanted to do
more for you."</p>

<p>"Why did you go away?" said Nettie harshly.</p>

<p>"I went on your account. You ain't mad about that, are you, girl? Why,
I wanted to make things softer for you, and I got a chance now to make
good money&mdash;$500, Nettie, and I says to myself: 'Here's where Nettie
and me'll go off on our honeymoon to the U.S.,' and I come up here now
thinking, 'Here's where we'll put one over on the Bull, and we'll slip
down to Calgary and get married, and then we get aboard the train. I'll
spring my wife on the outfit and&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>He choked and gulped, and Nettie moaned aloud, crying:</p>

<p>"I tell you I ain't the same. I'm changed. You oughtn't to've gone
away."</p>

<p>Dark suspicions began to mount and with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> growth jealous fury
caused him to swing her roughly about, so that again she faced him. But
she evaded his glance, turning her head from side to side, so that she
need not meet his accusing hot young eyes.</p>

<p>"You got another fellow, have you? Have you? You can answer that,
anyway."</p>

<p>But there was no answer from the girl, and as his grip relaxed on her
arms, her head dropped dumbly down. A cruel laugh broke from the boy's
lips.</p>

<p>"I see! Someone's cut me out, heh? I'm dead on to you now. I got your
number, I have. If you're that sort&mdash;if you couldn't stand a few
months' separation without goin' back on a fellow, I'm well rid of you.
I wish you luck with your new fellow. I hope he ain't the fool like I
been."</p>

<p>Still there was no answer from the girl, standing there with her head
down, and her arms hanging like a dead person's by her sides.</p>

<p>Presently there was a clatter of hoofs in the corral, and Cyril went
out at a furious trot. As the flying horseman disappeared over the
hills, Nettie slowly sank to her knees, and her arms stretched out, she
cried aloud:</p>

<p>"I wisht I was dead! I wisht I was dead!"</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>Cyril reached the purebred camp the following morning. He had ridden
without stopping the whole of the previous night. His mind was a
burning chaos; and he suffered all the torments of jealousy and
uncertainty. Even while he told himself that he now hated Nettie, his
heart went back to her&mdash;in aching tenderness about her. He pictured her
as he had known her&mdash;her hair shining in the sun, and that look which
love alone brings to the human eyes, lighting up her face and making it
divinely beautiful to her lover. He recalled her at the little shack,
where she had helped him fashion some of the rude pieces of furniture;
riding across the prairie, their horses' necks touching as they pressed
as close to each other as the horses would permit; the nightly meetings
in the berry bushes; her hand nestling in his own. He remembered her in
his arms, her lips upon his!</p>

<p>In the darkness of the night, the boy rode sobbing. In the gray of the
morning, red of eyes, his hat well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> over his face, he pulled into the
Bull camp, and with as steady a gait and voice as he could command he
faced Langdon.</p>

<p>"You back already?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ready to go on?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good. We'll get away a few days ahead. Hold on there!"</p>

<p>Cyril had moved to go. He stood now at the door of the cattle shed.</p>

<p>"Where've you been?"</p>

<p>There was no answer, and the Bull persisted.</p>

<p>"You been to Bar Q?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>There was silence again, and the Bull cut in with seeming indifference.</p>

<p>"How's your gell? When you gettin' married?"</p>

<p>A deep pause, and Cyril answered slowly.</p>

<p>"It's off. I ain't marryin'."</p>

<p>"Turned you down, did she? Huh! Well, what do you care? There's plenty
good fish in the sea. There ain't nothing to bellyache about. When you
get over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> to the States, you'll get all this female guff out of your
bones. Women ain't no good, anyways. They ain't worth fretting about.
They're a bad lot. Gimme <i>cattle</i> in preference."</p>

<p>He extended the plug of tobacco, which the boy ignored. His reddened
eyes looked levelly into the Bull's, and he said sturdily:</p>

<p>"It's a lie what you said about women. They ain't bad!"</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>Shut in all of that winter, throughout which spells of bitter cold had
alternated with blinding blizzards, dissipated only by the tempering
warmth of Chinook winds, Nettie and Mrs. Langdon were thrown upon their
own resources, and drew closer together.</p>

<p>As the winter deepened, something of the girl's strange depression
reacted upon the spirits of the sick woman, so that she, too, lapsed
into long spells of silence. She would lie on the couch in the
dining-living room close to the radiator, propped up high with the
pillows Nettie piled around her, her book on Health and Happiness
held loosely in her thin hands, as over and over again she conned its
lessons, beautiful lessons in which surely no one who read, could fail
to find that crumb of hope and comfort that means so much to the hungry
heart.</p>

<p>Occasionally her attention would stray from her beloved book, and then
she would lie there idly and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>absently watching the silent Nettie, as
she moved about her duties. One day, watching her more intently than
usual, and puzzling over the change in the formerly lighthearted and
happy girl, something about her movements, a certain lassitude, brought
Mrs. Langdon's thoughts to an abrupt pause. At first she put the idea
from her as fantastic and impossible; but moving round the better to
scrutinize the girl, she knew she had made no mistake. The book slipped
from her hand. Mrs. Langdon sat up on her couch, and stared with a
startled gaze at Nettie Day. The fall of the book caused the girl to
turn from her work, and as she stooped to pick it up, she met her
mistress's eyes.</p>

<p>"Come here, Nettie. I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>Nettie advanced slowly, instinctively holding back, and in her unquiet
heart there stirred a dread of the question she knew was trembling on
her mistress's lips. Mrs. Langdon's eyes rose steadily, as she scanned
the girl from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Nettie, you are in <i>trouble</i>!"</p>

<p>Nettie could not speak for the tightness in her throat and held her dry
lips pressed together.</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor child! You poor little girl! Why didn't you tell me
before? <i>Now</i> I understand!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Nettie moved around sideways, averting her gaze from those eyes so full
of compassion and tenderness.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Langdon," she said in a low voice, "I done nothing wrong."</p>

<p>"Oh, Nettie! Don't deny it, dear. I can see for myself. Sit beside me,
dear. I am not condemning you. I only want your confidence. Tell me all
about it, Nettie."</p>

<p>"I <i>can't</i> tell you, Mrs. Langdon! I <i>can't</i>. It's something can never
be told you."</p>

<p>Nettie was past that stage where tears would have relieved her. All of
her senses seemed numbed and hardened, but she clung persistently to
the one passionate purpose, to hide the truth, at all costs, from Mrs.
Langdon.</p>

<p>Of all who had known Bull Langdon, his wife alone, despite her cruel
experiences with him over the years, did not hate him. To her, he
was an erring child, who had started on the wrong trail, and went,
misguided and blind, stumbling on in the darkness, never finding his
way to that peaceful haven of thought that had been his wife's comfort
and refuge. Incapable of evil herself, she had the child's simple faith
in the goodness of others, or in their ultimate regeneration from
wrong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> or error, as she preferred to call it. She never wavered in her
faith that sooner or later her "lost lamb" would return to the fold.</p>

<p>It was probable that only her strange faith in the Bull had kept him
from doing her physical harm. Harsh and gruff and neglectful, he had
never been actually cruel to her, and to himself he liked to boast
defiantly that he had "never raised his hand" to his wife.</p>

<p>Now, as she begged for Nettie's confidence, she never dreamed of
connecting her husband with the girl's trouble; that was a crime she
never could have suspected.</p>

<p>"Do you realize, Nettie, what is about to happen to you?"</p>

<p>"I expect you'll want to turn me out now," said Nettie dully, and then
turning swiftly, she added with sudden force: "But don't do it till the
spring, Mrs. Langdon, because you ain't strong enough to do the work
this winter, and it's nothing to me, and I want to stay and take care
of you."</p>

<p>"Don't you know me better than that? Turn your face around, Nettie. Do
you think I'm the kind of woman to turn a girl out because she is going
to be what I have all my life longed to be&mdash;a mother?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't! Oh, don't, don't!" cried the girl, loudly, rocking to and fro
in tearless anguish. "I wisht I were dead. I wisht I'd had the nerve to
drown myself in the Ghost River, but now it's all froze over."</p>

<p>"It's wicked to talk in that way. Why should you wish to drown
yourself? I am not judging you. I only want to help you. Things are
clear to me now. Cyril&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't, Mrs. Langdon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't what?"</p>

<p>"Don't speak his name even."</p>

<p>"Why not? Why should you carry this burden alone? If there's any blame,
it belongs to him, not you."</p>

<p>"No! No! He never done anything wrong. He's not capable of doing wrong
to a girl. Please don't say anything about him. I can't bear it!"</p>

<p>"But we must face this thing fairly. You are in an abnormal condition
of mind. It's not an uncommon thing. Some women lose their minds at
this time. I appreciate all that you have been suffering, and I pity
you from the very bottom of my heart."</p>

<p>Nettie said nothing now, but she wrung her hands and clenched them
together as if in physical pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen to me, Nettie dear. I want you to know that <i>I</i> know what it
means to be as you are." Her voice dropped to a wistful whisper. "Eight
times, dear, just think of that. You know we pioneered in the early
days. We didn't always have a grand place like this, and&mdash;and&mdash;well,
in those days the distances were so great. We were so far from
everything&mdash;it was just as if we were on the end of the world, and we
didn't have the conveniences, or even vehicles to carry us places,
and the doctors always came too late, or not at all. I lost all of my
babies. They just came into the world to&mdash;to go out again; but I always
thought that even the weakest of them had not lived in vain, because
you see, they brought something lovely into my life. It was just as
if&mdash;as if&mdash;an angel's wing had touched me, don't you see? It brought
to me a knowledge of Love&mdash;love eternal and everlasting. No woman who
bears a child can fail to feel it."</p>

<p>She broke off, in strange, breathless, smiling pause, as if she sought
to conquer her present pain with the elusive joy that she believed
had come with her dead children into her life. "So you see, Nettie, I
don't hold anything against any woman who bears a child, no matter how
or where. It doesn't matter what you or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> Cyril have done. I have great
faith in that boy, and I feel he will make it right."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Langdon," said Nettie in a suffocating voice, "I ask you not to
believe that he is to blame for anything wrong about me."</p>

<p>"I won't, then. I'll believe the best of you both. We are going to be
very happy, all of us. Just think, you are going to be a mother! It's
the sublimest feeling in life. I know it, because all my life I've
heard baby voices in my ears and in my heart, Nettie, and my arms have
ached and yearned to press a little baby to my breast. My own dear
little ones have passed, but, Nettie, I'll hold yours, won't I, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Langdon, when you talk like that, I feel just as if something
was bursting all up inside me. I don't know what to do."</p>

<p>"Do nothing, dear; but look out at God's beautiful world. Lift your
eyes to the skies, to the sun, to the hills' hills!"</p>

<p>"There's no sun no more," said Nettie. "The days are all dark and cold
now, and the hills are all froze, too. They're like me, Mrs. Langdon.
I'm all froze up inside."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you'll change now. Look, Nettie, it won't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> be long before
they'll be back&mdash;my husband and your Cyril. I had a letter. Where is
it, now? I put it in my book&mdash;no, under my pillow. See, what they
write." The paper fluttered in her hand, and she looked up to smile
at Nettie. "It was thoughtful of Bill, wasn't it, to have the letter
typed? You know he hates to write letters. Poor fellow hasn't much
of an education&mdash;You know, Nettie, he came to the school when I was
teaching, to learn. It was pathetic, really it was. But now, he's had
some stenographer write to tell me that they'll be home in a couple of
weeks. They should have been home two months ago, but they've had a
terrible time of it in the States. You see there's a kind of sickness
over there&mdash;a plague that's running around. It's all over Europe and
now the States. People, he writes, are afraid to go to public places,
and everything is closed up. It's a great disappointment for him, poor
fellow. He expected so much from the Prince, and he's hung on from
week to week, and been through all sorts of aggravating times. You
know they even quarantined his herd on a false suspicion of disease,
when they were in <i>perfect</i> health. But, never mind, we have to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>disappointments in life. All I'm thankful for now is that he's coming
back&mdash;he and Cyril."</p>

<p>Nettie said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Langdon, I don't want to see neither of them again. I can't."</p>

<p>"That's the way you feel now. It's natural in your condition. I had
notions, too. Wanted the strangest things to eat, and had <i>such</i> fits
of crying about nothing at all. You'll be all over these moods by the
time Cyril rides in. My! I'm going to scold that boy. Yes, yes, you
may be angry if you want, but I'm going to give him a real piece of my
mind, and then&mdash;well, it's never too late to mend a wrong, Nettie."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Langdon," said Nettie violently, "I tell you Cyril Stanley never
done me no wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, that's how you look at it, Nettie, and maybe you are right. I'm
the last person to judge you."</p>

<p>Nettie bent down suddenly and grasping Mrs. Langdon's thin hand
tightly, she kissed it. Then as quickly dropping it, she got up, threw
her apron over her face and ran from the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>In the winter the Bar Q outfit in the foothill ranch had dwindled down
to eight men. These were all riders, men who "rode the fences" and
kept them in repair; men who rode the range, and made the rounds of
the fields, counted and kept account of the cattle remaining on the
ranch, and reported sick or crippled cattle to the veterinary surgeon
maintained at the ranch.</p>

<p>The breeding stock had been despatched to the prairie ranch in the
fall, where they were especially housed and cared for. The beef stock,
three-year-old steers, were also disposed at the grain ranch, where
they were fed on chop and green feed and hay, to fatten them for the
spring market.</p>

<p>The purebred heifers and cows had their own home at Barstairs, where
also was the camp of the purebred bulls.</p>

<p>At the foothill ranch only the younger stuff was left, the yearling and
rising two-year-old heifers and steers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> and these sturdy young stuff
"rustled" over the winter range, finding sufficient sustenance to carry
them through the winter. The cook car was closed, and the men "batched"
in the bunkhouses but came to the main ranch house for bread, butter
and general supplies.</p>

<p>Nettie, long ignorant of her condition, had from day to day passed
out the supplies to the men, unconscious of and indifferent to their
scrutiny. She failed to realize that what had become apparent to her
mistress, had also been revealed to the cunning eyes of the Bar Q
"hands."</p>

<p>Bunkhouses in a ranching country are breeding places for the worst
kind of gossip and scandal, to which disgusting commerce men even more
than women are addicted. It was, therefore, not long before Nettie's
name became first whispered and then carelessly bandied among them. At
her name eyes rolled, winks and coarse laughter were the rule where
but a little while ago she had been the object of admiring respect and
aspiration.</p>

<p>Cyril Stanley's name was also on each man's tongue, and they all took
it for granted that he was responsible for Nettie's condition. A change
in their manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> toward the girl followed the loose talk about her;
there were certain meaning looks, a new familiarity of speech, and
presently worse than that. "Pink-eyed" Tom, a man whose dirty boasts
concerning women were a source of endless fun among the men, came to
the house one day for a side of bacon. He followed Nettie into the big
storeroom, where the Bar Q meat supply hung. As she passed the bacon
to him, Pink-Eye managed to seize her hand, and with a broad grin, he
squeezed it, and attempted to draw her to him. It was only a momentary
grasp, but with the chuckle that went with it the girl understood and
turned first deathly white and scarlet with anger.</p>

<p>"Guess you ain't used to man-handling&mdash;oh, no!" said Tom, and as she
fiercely withdrew from his grasp, he laughed in her face, with an ugly
meaning leer that set her heart frantically beating.</p>

<p>She flew from the storeroom to the kitchen, and stood with her back
pressed against the door, holding it closed. A sickening fear of the
whole race of men consumed her. She longed to escape to some place
beyond their sight or ken where she might at least hide herself and
be allowed the boon of suffering unmolested and unseen. She had a
passionate longing to escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> from the Bar Q&mdash;to leave forever the
hateful place where she had been so cruelly betrayed, where she had
suffered almost beyond endurance. But the thought of leaving Mrs.
Langdon hurt her more than the thought of staying, and her mind
wandered in the hopeless search of a solution to her appalling problem.
She thought of her friend "Angel" Loring, with her cropped hair and
men's clothing, and for the first time comprehended what might drive a
woman to do as the Englishwoman had done.</p>

<p>"A bad report runs a thousand miles a minute," says an oriental
proverb. Certainly that is true of a ranching country. From bunkhouse
to farm and ranch house raced the tale of a girl's fall; it was a
morsel of exciting news to those dull souls shut in by the rigid hand
of the winter.</p>

<p>On the first Chinook day, women harnessed teams to democrats and single
drivers to buggies, and took the road to Bar Q. Never had that ranch
been favored with so many visitors. Neither Nettie nor her mistress
suspected that their guests had come to see for themselves whether
there was truth in the story concerning the girl which had percolated
over the telephone and been carried by riders intent upon retailing
the latest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> sensation of the foothills. Caste exists not in a ranching
country like Alberta, save among a few rare and exclusive souls, and
a hired girl on a ranch has her own social standing in the community,
especially if she is that rarity, a pretty girl. So Nettie's plight was
of as supreme an interest to the ranch and farm wives as if instead
of a poor servant girl she had been any prosperous farmer's daughter.
Hired girls are potential wives for the best of the ranchmen, and many
a farmer's wife has begun her career on a cook car.</p>

<p>Nettie, cutting cake and brewing tea in the kitchen, paused, tray in
hand, white-faced, behind the door, as the voices of the women close at
hand floated through.</p>

<p>"Looked me right in the face, innocent as a lamb, and she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's six months gone if a day."</p>

<p>"Seem's if she might've gone straight, being the oldest in the family.
You'd thought she'd want to set an example to her little brothers and
sisters."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! she should worry."</p>

<p>"Ain't girls awful today!"</p>

<p>"When you told me on the 'phone, I couldn't b'lieve it, and I come
along on purpose to make sure for myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, now you see, though I'm not used to havin' my word doubted."</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Munson, I hadn't the idea of questioning your word; but I
thought as you hadn't seen for yourself, and got it third-hand."</p>

<p>"I got it straight&mdash;straight from Batt Leeson, and <i>he</i> ought to know
after workin' more'n ten years at the Bar Q."</p>

<p>"Personally, I make a point of standing up for the girl."</p>

<p>The voice this time was a shade gentler, but it was also flurried and
apologetic.</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do, Mrs. Young, if a girl acts decent, men let
her alone. You can tell me!"</p>

<p>Her face stony, her head held high, Nettie pushed the door open with
her foot, and came in with the tray. She silently served them, but her
glance flickered toward her mistress, who was leaning forward listening
to the whispered words of Mrs. Peterson, cringing toward the rich
cattleman's wife. For the first time since she had known her, Mrs.
Langdon's voice sounded sharp and cold.</p>

<p>"I'll thank you not to repeat a nasty tale like that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> Nettie Day has
just as much right to have a child as you have."</p>

<p>"Why, I'm a married woman," blurted the outraged farm wife.</p>

<p>"How do you know Nettie isn't married?"</p>

<p>Chairs were hunched forward. The circle leaned with pricked-up ears
toward the speaker.</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> she, now?"</p>

<p>"Well, that accounts for it!"</p>

<p>"You couldn't make me believe Nettie was that kind. We all
thought&mdash;well, you know how girls carry on today. I'm sure you'll
excuse us. We're all li'ble to make mistakes."</p>

<p>The Inquisition turned to Nettie.</p>

<p>"My word, Nettie Day, why didn't you let us know? What on earth did you
want to keep it secret for? The whole country'd turned out to Chivaree
for you. We haven't had a marriage in a year, and Cyril Stanley is
mighty popular with the boys."</p>

<p>Nettie's gaze went slowly around that circle of faces. She wanted to
make sure that all might hear her words.</p>

<p>"I ain't married to Cyril Stanley, and he done me no wrong. You got no
right to talk his name loose like that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>An exclamatory silence reigned in the room. Mrs. Langdon, her cheeks
very flushed, was sitting up, her bright eyes, like a bird's, scanning
the faces of her visitors.</p>

<p>"Nettie," her thin, piercing voice was raised, "you forgot my tea,
and&mdash;and&mdash;maybe you ladies'll excuse me today. I'm not well, you know."</p>

<p>For the first time since she had become a convert to her strange
philosophy she was admitting illness; but she was doing it in another's
behalf.</p>

<p>As the last of the women disappeared through the door, and before the
murmur of their voices outside had died out, Mrs. Langdon made a motion
of her hands toward Nettie, and the girl ran over, dropped on her knees
by the couch and hid her face in her mistress's lap.</p>

<p>"Nettie, don't you mind what they say. Women are terribly cruel to each
other. I don't know why they should be, I'm sure, for I believe that we
all have in us the same capacities for sinning, only most of us escape
temptation. It's almost a gamble, isn't it, Nettie; and I'm so sorry,
poor child, that you should have been the one to lose." Her voice
dropped to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> whisper. "I'll confess something to you now, Nettie.
<i>I</i>&mdash;yes, I&mdash;almost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you're goin' to say something against yourself," said Nettie
hoarsely, "I don't want to hear it. You ain't capable ever of doing
anything wrong."</p>

<p class="space-above">On the road, the carriages were grouped together. Their occupants
leaned out and called back and forth to each other.</p>

<p>"What do you know of that?"</p>

<p>"I'm certainly surprised at Mrs. Langdon. I didn't think she'd hold to
anything like that."</p>

<p>"I did, and I'm not a bit surprised. I could've told you a thing or
two. Birds of a feather flock together, and she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Voices were lowered, as another woman's reputation was pulled to shreds.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Munson, you don't say so."</p>

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>"I remember when the Bull first married her. Sa-ay, there was all kinds
of talk. Ask anyone who was here in them times."</p>

<p>Murmurs and exclamations, and a woman's voice rumbling out a tale that
should never have been told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you've believed it! And she so sweet and sly of tongue."</p>

<p>"Still waters run deep. You can't trust them quiet kind. I had it
direct from Jem Bowers. You know Jem. He was right along when it
happened. They were shut in that schoolhouse for two whole days, and
the door locked and bolted. The Bull himself asked Jem to go for the
missionary, and everyone knows Jem was one of the witnesses at the
Langdon wedding. Said she looked just like a little scared bird, and
her eyes were all screwed up with crying, so I guess doin' wrong did
bring <i>her</i> no happiness."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd never have believed it if you hadn't told me. I'm going to
hustle right off now. I want to stop and see Mrs. Durkin on my way. She
couldn't get off to come, as they've had the mumps up to their house,
and I promised to let her know, and I'll bet her tongue's hangin' out
waitin'."</p>

<p>"Well, don't say I said it."</p>

<p>"I won't. I'll say I got it from&mdash;from&mdash;I'll not name the party. Get
ap, Gate! My, that mare's smart."</p>

<p>"I like geldings for driving. They aren't so quick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> but they're
dependable and strong. Good-by. Will you be at the box social?"</p>

<p>"Sure, what's it for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, them sick folks in the east. Did you hear that that plague
sickness they got in the States has sneaked across to Canada, and
everybody's scared nearly to death. They've got it awful out in Toronto
and Montreal."</p>

<p>"Didn't know it was as bad as that."</p>

<p>"It's something awful out east I heard. My husband brought home a paper
from Calgary, and they had the whole front page in headlines about it.
Them Yankees brought it in with them when they run away to escape from
it in their own country. Wish they'd stay home and look after their own
sicknesses, 'stead of coming across the line and carrying it along with
them. Others have been flying out west here, and they say if we don't
look out, first thing we know Calgary'll have it, and then&mdash;well, it'll
be our turn. I heard they were shipping all the sick ones out of the
city to the country."</p>

<p>The women looked at each other waveringly, licking their lips and
turning white with dread. They drew their rugs closer about them and
said they had to be off, as it was getting dark and they didn't want
to catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> cold, and no one ever knew when a change might blow up in
the weather and that cloud off to the north looked mighty threatening.
In the sudden panic of the approaching plague, Nettie was for the time
being forgotten. The clatter and rattle of their wheels was heard along
the road, as with whip and tongue they urged their horses homeward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>All night long the wind blew wildly. It raved like a live, mad thing,
tearing across the country with tornado-like force.</p>

<p>The house shock and rocked upon its foundations, the rattling windows
and clattering doors ready to be burst open every moment.</p>

<p>To the girl, lying wide-eyed throughout the night, it seemed almost
as if the voice of the wild wind had the triumphant, mocking tone of
the man she loathed. It seemed to typify his immense strength, his
power and madness. It was gloating, triumphing over her, buffeting and
trampling her down.</p>

<p>Nettie was not given to self-analysis, but for all her simplicity she
was capable of intense feeling. Behind her slow thought there slumbered
an unlimited capacity for suffering. Now even the elements were preying
upon her morbid imagination. She could not sleep for the raging of the
terrific wind, the incessant shaking of windows and doors, and all the
sounds of a loosely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> built old ranch house, rattling and trembling
in the furious tempest. As she lay in bed, her face crushed into her
pillow, her hands over her ears, as though to deaden the roar of the
wind, she could not rid her mind of the thought of the man she hated.
She was doomed that night to relive the hideous hours spent with him,
until, the vision becoming intolerable to her fevered mind, she sprang
up in bed, and rocking herself to and fro like one half demented, sat
in judgment upon her own acts.</p>

<p>Why had she not killed herself? Why was she living on? Why was she
crouched here now upon her bed, when the Ghost River was at hand? True,
it was frozen over, but there were great water holes, where the cattle
came to drink, and into one of these she might throw herself as into
a deep well. Oblivion would come then. Her sick mind would no longer
conjure up the loathsome vision of Bull Langdon, and her ears would be
deaf to the taunting, beating challenge of the wind, calling to her
with its roaring voice to come forth and fight hand to hand with the
fates that had crushed her.</p>

<p>"I got to go out!" she moaned. "I got to go out! I can't live no
longer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>She put her foot over the side of the bed, and with her head uplifted
she listened to what her disordered mind fancied was a voice out of the
river, calling to her above the raging of the wind. And as she sat in
the dark room, above the raving of the wind, she heard indeed a call&mdash;a
living voice. Instantly she drew up tensely, holding her breath the
more clearly to catch the faint cry.</p>

<p>"Nettie! Nettie!"</p>

<p>It was her mistress. She was out of bed, fumbling for the matches.</p>

<p>The Bar Q was equipped with electricity, but the wires were not
connected with the hired girl's room. It was a pitch-dark night.
Frightened as she was of the darkness and the storm, the cry of her
well-loved mistress awoke all the defensive bravery of her nature, and
she called aloud in reply, feeling along the walls, groping her way to
the door.</p>

<p>"I'm coming, Mrs. Langdon! I'm coming! I'm coming!"</p>

<p>In the hall she found the electric button, and hurried across to Mrs.
Langdon's room. She found the cattleman's wife propped high up on her
pillow, breathing with the difficulty of an asthmatic. The window was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
wide open, and the shades flapped angrily and tore at the rollers. The
face on the bed smiled up wanly at Nettie in the reflected light from
the hall.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Langdon, did you call me? Do you want something?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. I thought maybe you wouldn't mind closing my window for me.
I tried to get up myself, but I had a sort of presentiment that&mdash;that
you were awake and that perhaps you would&mdash;would like to come to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was awake, wide, wide awake. I couldn't sleep to save myself.
Isn't the wind terrible!"</p>

<p>"It's dying down, I think."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's fiercer than ever," cried the girl wildly. "It's just
terrible. I can't bear to hear it. I been awake all night. Just seems
as if that wind was shoutin' and screamin' and makin' mock of me, Mrs.
Langdon. It's banging upon my&mdash;heart. I <i>hate</i> the wind. I think it's
alive&mdash;a horrible, wild thing. It fights and laughs at me. It's driving
me mad."</p>

<p>"Ah, Nettie, you are not yourself these days. It is not the wind, but
what is in your heart that speaks. We can even control the wind if we
wish. Christ did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> and the Christ spirit is in us all, if we only knew
how to use it."</p>

<p>Nettie had closed the windows. On her knees by Mrs. Langdon's bed,
she was pulling the covers up and tucking them closely about her, and
chafing the thin, cold hands.</p>

<p>"You're cold. Your hands are just like ice. I'm going downstairs to
heat some water and fill the hot-water bag for you."</p>

<p>"No, no, Nettie. You go right back to bed. I'll go down myself by and
by, if I feel the need of the bag."</p>

<p>But though Nettie promised to go back to bed, she hurried down to the
lower floor. She had no longer fear of the wind or the darkness. Her
mind was intent upon securing the hot-water bag, and she built up a
fire in the dead range, and set the kettle upon it.</p>

<p>She was bending over the wood-box, picking but a likely log, when
something stirred behind her. Still stooping, she remained still and
tense. Slowly the Bull's great arms reached down from behind and
enfolded her.</p>

<p>The noise of the wind had deadened his approach to the house. He had
come through the living room to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> the opened kitchen door, by the stove
of which was the bending girl.</p>

<p>She twisted about in his arms, only to bring her face directly against
his own. She was held in a vise, in the arms of the huge cattleman. His
hoarse whispers were muttered against her mouth, her cheek, her neck.</p>

<p>He chuckled and gloated as she fought for her freedom, dumbly, for her
thoughts flew up to the woman upstairs. Above all things, Mrs. Langdon
must be spared a knowledge of that which was happening to Nettie.</p>

<p>"Ain't no use to struggle! Ain't no use to cry," he chortled. "I got
you tight, and there ain't no one to hear. I been thinkin' of you day
and night, gell, for months now, and I been countin' off the minutes
for this."</p>

<p>She cried in a strangled voice:</p>

<p>"She's upstairs! She'll hear you! Oh, she's coming down. Oh, don't you
hear her? Oh, for the love of God! let me go."</p>

<p>The man heard nothing but his clamoring desires.</p>

<p>"Gimme your lips!" said the Bull huskily.</p>

<p>The clipclop of those loose slippers clattering on the stairs broke
upon the hush that had fallen in the kitchen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> Through all her agony
Nettie heard the sound of those little feet, and she knew&mdash;she
felt&mdash;just when they had stopped at the lower step as Mrs. Langdon
clung to the bannister. Slowly the wife of the cowman sank to the
lowest step. She did not lose consciousness, but an icy stiffness crept
over her face; her jaw dropped, and a glaze came like a veil before her
staring eyes.</p>

<p>With a superhuman effort Nettie had obtained her release. She sprang to
Mrs. Langdon, and groveled at her feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Langdon, it 'twant my fault. I didn't mean to do no harm. Oh,
Mrs. Langdon, I wisht I'd heeded the wind! It must've been warning me.
I wisht I'd gone to the Ghost River, when it called to me to come."</p>

<p>Mrs. Langdon's head had slowly dropped forward, just as if the neck had
broken. Nettie, beneath her, sought the glance of her eyes, and saw the
effort of the moving lips.</p>

<p>"God's&mdash;will," said the woman slowly. "A dem-on-stration&mdash;of&mdash;God.
I&mdash;had&mdash;to leave, Nettie. God's will you&mdash;take&mdash;my&mdash;place."</p>

<p>Across the half-paralyzed face something flickered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> strangely like
a faint smile. Then the girl saw her mistress fall, inert and still
against the staircase.</p>

<p>A loud cry broke from the frantic Nettie.</p>

<p>"We've killed her! We've killed Mrs. Langdon!"</p>

<p>"Killed her&mdash;nothing," said the man hoarsely, his face twitching and
his hands shaking. "I told you she was 'bout ready to croak, and you
heard what she said. You was to take her place. That means&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nettie had arisen, and her eyes wide with loathing she stared at him
in a sort of mad fury. Somehow she seemed to grow strong and tall, and
there was a light of murder in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I'd sooner drown myself in the Ghost River," she said.</p>

<p>Like one gone blind she felt her way to her room, and this time the man
did not follow her.</p>

<p>The wind raved on; the windows shook; the door easements creaked as
if an angry hand were upon them; the white curtains flapped in and
out. There was the heavy tramp of men's feet upon the stair; the rough
murmur of men's voices in the hall. She knew they were carrying the
dead woman to her room.</p>

<p>Hours of silence followed. The Bull had gone with his men to the
bunkhouse, and she was alone in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> house with the dead woman. For
the first time, a sense of peace, a passionate gladness swept over the
tortured girl. Mrs. Langdon would know the truth at last! She would
have no blame in her heart for Nettie&mdash;&mdash; Nettie, who had a psychic
sense of the warm nearness and understanding of the woman who had
passed away.</p>

<p>As she dressed in the darkness of the room, Nettie talked to her, she
believed was with her, catching her breath in trembling little sobs and
laughs of reassurance.</p>

<p>"You understand now, don't you, and you don't hold it against me? I
didn't mean no wrong.... I done the best I could. You don't ask me to
stay now that you know, do you, dear?"</p>

<p>The plaid woolen shawl, a Christmas gift from Mrs. Langdon, covered her
completely. The gray light of dawn was filtering through the house; the
wind had died down. In its place the snow was falling upon the land,
spotless and silent. Nettie's face was whiter than the snow as she
left her room. Mrs. Langdon's door was closed, and, hesitating only a
moment, Nettie stole to it on tiptoe. With her face pressed against it,
she called to the woman inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-by, Mrs. Langdon. Nobody will ever be so kind to me in this world
as you have been."</p>

<p>She listened, almost as if she heard that faint, sweet voice in reply.
Then, strangely comforted, she wrapped her cape closer about her, and
in her rubbered feet Nettie Day stole down the stairs and went out into
the storm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>The veteran geldings that had pulled Dr. McDermott for years over the
roads of Alberta had long since been replaced by a gallant little Ford,
that purred and grunted its way along the roads and trails in all kinds
of weather, and performed miraculous feats over the roughest of trails,
across fields, plowed land, chugging sturdily through to the medical
man's goal.</p>

<p>Many of the farmers belonged to that type that seemed to believe
implicitly in the proverb, "Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be
wise." They laughed or poohpoohed the doctor's warning admonitions in
regard to the plague, already as far west as Winnipeg. They "joshed"
and "guyed" him, and asked: "Lookin' for trade, doc? You can't make
me sick with your pills, so you better keep them to home. Haw, haw!"
And they threw the disinfectant and pills (to be taken should certain
symptoms develop) away out of sight and mind, and made jokes when he
was gone about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> "Doc gettin' cold feet like the city guys. If he don't
look out he'll be gittin' just like them paper collar dudes in town and
want soothin' syrup for white liver." They hugged to themselves the
imbecile delusion that since they lived a cleaner and healthier life
than mere city dwellers, they would prove immune to diseases that were
a peculiarity of the city.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to mention here that county and city
hospitals numbered among their patients far more people from the
country than the cities, and that the insane asylums were almost wholly
recruited from the lone farm and ranch houses, where the monotonous
pressure of the long life of loneliness took its due toll of those
condemned, as it were, to solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Howbeit, the "doc" kept his stubborn vigil. He did not propose to be
caught "napping," and he traveled the roads of Alberta, going from
ranch to ranch, with his warnings and instructions and despised pills.</p>

<p>While returning from some such expedition into the foothills he
stopped, in the dawn of the day, to fasten the curtains about his car,
as the wind of the wild night before had turned with the morning into
a snowstorm. A straight, level road was before him, and the doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
figured on making Cochrane in half an hour. Up to this time, in spite
of the weather and the perilous trail to Banff, he had had no trouble
with the engine. Now, however, as he cranked, the Ford, a peculiarly
temperamental and uncertain car, refused to produce the spark. He
lifted the hood, made an inspection, cranked again and again; held
his side, and groaned and grunted with the exertion, raged and cussed
a bit, regretted the old veterans; then, throwing his dogskin coat
over the engine, he searched for the trouble underneath. He was lying
on his back, a sheepskin under him, tinkering away with the "dommed
cantankerous works," when, putting out his head to look for his wrench,
he saw something approaching on the road that caused him to sit bolt
upright in blank astonishment.</p>

<p>Her cape flapping about her, her head weighed down with the falling
snow, her eyes wide and blank, snow-blind, Nettie Day swept before
the wind on the Banff trail. The doctor, on his feet now, blocked her
further passage, for she seemed not to see him but to be walking in a
somnambulist's trance.</p>

<p>"What are you doin' on the road at this hour, lass?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, but stared out blankly before her, shaking her
snow-crowned head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>A quick professional glance at the girl and the doctor realized her
condition and the need for immediate action. She made no demur; indeed,
was touchingly meek, as he assisted her into the car. He tucked the
fur robe about her, buttoned the curtains tightly, and, his face
puckered with concern, he poured out a stiff "peg" of whisky. She drank
mechanically, gulping slightly as the spirits burnt her throat. Her
eyes were drooping drowsily, and when the doctor put his sheepskin
under her head, she sighed with intense weariness, and then lay still
at the bottom of the car.</p>

<p>The doctor "doggoned" that engine, shoved the crank in, and,
miraculously, there was the healthy chug-chug of the engine, and the
little car went roaring on its way.</p>

<p>"You're a dommed good lad!" gloated Dr. McDermott and pulled on his
dogskin gloves, wiped the frost from the glass, threw a glance back to
make sure the girl was all right, and put on top speed.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>The Lady Angella Luring arose at five in the morning, put on overalls,
sheepskin coat, woolen gauntlets, and heavy overshoes. She tramped
through the steadily falling snow to her barn, which housed a cow, a
sow, a mare heavy in foal, a saddle horse and the poultry.</p>

<p>The March winds that had raged all the previous night had turned with
the morning to a snowstorm, and the flakes were now falling so heavily
that the barn was only just visible from the house as the woman rancher
plodded through the blinding flakes.</p>

<p>First she threw into the pig-pen the pails of swill and mush she had
brought from the house, then watered the stock, no easy matter, for the
pumped water froze quickly in the trough, and she was forced to refill
it several times. That done, she climbed into the hayloft, and with her
pitchfork thrust down through the openings the morning feed for the
cow, carefully measured chop from the bin for the mare, allowing half
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> pail of oats and a bunch of hay for the saddle horse; she threw to
the chickens, hens that had followed hungrily in her wake, a pan full
of ground barley and wheat seasoned with cayenne pepper, epsom salts
and bits of bones and eggshells.</p>

<p>Finally she went to her milking. The cow was fresh, and she had a
full pail. Half of this, however, she fed to the restless little
calf, nosing near its mother, and trying to shake off the muzzle that
Angella had snapped on the night before in order to wean it. The task
of feeding the calf required patience and time, for the restive little
"dogie" nearly knocked over the pail, and had to be taught how to drink
by feeling the woman's fingers thrust, wet with the milk, into its
mouth. She was more than an hour about her chores. With the half-filled
pail in one hand, she tramped back to the house through the snow,
falling now more heavily than before.</p>

<p>Before leaving the house Angella had lit her fire, and now the place
was warm and snug, and the singing kettle lent it an air of cheer.
There was a certain attractiveness about the poor shack on the prairie,
in spite of its rough, bare log walls and two wee windows. Though she
chose to wear men's clothing, and had cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> her hair like a man's, yet
one had only to look about that room to perceive that the eternal
feminine had persisted notwithstanding her angry and pitiful attempt to
quench it.</p>

<p>She had made most of the furniture herself, crude pieces fashioned from
willow fence posts and grocery boxes, yet they betrayed a craftsman's
talent, for the chairs, though designed for use, were rustic and
pretty, and she had touched them in spots with bright red paint. The
table, over which a vivid red oilcloth was nailed, made a bright patch
of color in the room. Red, in most places, for decorative purposes,
can be used only sparingly, but in a bleak log shack a splash of this
ruddy color gives both warmth and cheer. The floor had been scrubbed
until it was almost white, and a big red-brown cowhide made a carpet
near the couch, which was covered with a calfskin. Indian ornaments and
beadwork, bits of crockery and pewter were on the shelves that lined
one side of the shack, and where also she kept her immaculately shining
kettles, cooking utensils and dishes. A curtain of burlap sacks, edged
with scarlet cloth, hung before the bedroom doorway. The pillows on
the spotless bed were covered with cases made of flour bags. A large
grocers' box, into which shelves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> had been nailed, was also covered
with similar cloth and served as a sort of dressing table. Two chairs,
made from smaller boxes, were padded with burlap, and a triangular
shelf with a curtain before it made a closet in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>A huge gray cat followed the woman recluse about the room, sleepily
rubbing itself against her, and purring with contentment when she
picked it up in her arms.</p>

<p>Angella made her breakfast of oatmeal and tea, serving from the
stove directly onto her plate. Her cat nestled in her lap while she
breakfasted, and she smoothed it absently as she ate.</p>

<p>Time had smoothed out the lines on her face instead of adding to them,
and the strained look of suffering in her eyes had given way to a
healthy gaze. Her skin had almost the fresh color of a girl's. Her
hair had grown abundantly, though it still was short and almost gray,
but its natural curliness lent her face a soft and youthful air. There
was no sign of the dread disease which had once threatened her life.
She looked normal and wholesome as she sat at her table, her cat in
her lap, deep in a brown study. It would be hard to say what filled
Angella's thoughts when she was thus shut in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> alone in her shack upon
the prairie. She had ceased long since to conjure up bitter visions of
the man who was responsible for her father's death and her own exile.
Her thoughts, at least, were no longer unbearably painful as in those
early days when first she had come to Alberta, and many a day and
night, shut in alone with her dismal secret, she had wrestled in bitter
anguish with the crowding thoughts that came like ghosts to haunt her.</p>

<p>However, even in winter she had little enough time for thinking. Her
life was crowded with work. When she had finished her meal, she washed
her dishes, made her bed, kneaded the dough for her weekly baking,
set a pot of beans, soaked overnight, into the oven, and prepared to
go out again, this time to the pasture, where her few head of stock
"rustled" for their feed all winter. A snowstorm at this time of year
is always dangerous for the breeding stock dropping their calves with
the approach of the spring. There were water holes, too, in the frozen
slough that had to be broken in every day so that the cattle might have
the water they needed. Angella, ax in hand, opened the door of her
shack. A gale of wind and snow almost blinded her, so that at first she
did not see the Ford that was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>plowing its way noisily and pluckily
down the road allowance that led to her house. At the honk of the
doctor's horn, which he worked steadily to attract her, she peered out
through the storm, and she turned to the gate, where the car had now
stopped.</p>

<p>She never encouraged the visits of Dr. McDermott, who had saved her
life when first she had come to Alberta; but neither was she ever
uncivil when he did come. Time had accustomed her to his regular calls,
and, in truth, though she would not have admitted it for anything in
the world, she had come to look forward to these visits, and to depend
upon them for her news of the world, which she so bitterly told herself
she had cast off forever.</p>

<p>Now, as his ruddy face was thrust through the curtains, Angella,
frowning slightly, tramped to the car.</p>

<p>"Are you strong enough to lend me a hand lifting something?" asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Certainly I'm strong enough. What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott, out of the car now, unbuttoned the back curtains, and
revealed to the amazed Angella the still heavily sleeping Nettie.</p>

<p>"There's a sick lass here," he said solemnly, "and a lass in sore
trouble, I'm thinking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>A strange expression had come into the face of Angella Loring. Not so
long since, it seemed to her, she had seen as in a dream this girl
now lying on the floor of the doctor's car leaning over her, and had
regarded her with the tender, compassionate gaze of her own mother. In
the days of semi-consciousness that had followed her first seizure, the
Englishwoman could endure the sight and touch of no one but the girl
with the Madonna face. Without realizing what was amiss, all she knew
was that Nettie was now as helpless as she had been when the girl had
cared for her, and without a word or a question she helped the doctor
lift Nettie out of the car and to carry her into the house.</p>

<p>Angella Loring believed that there was nothing about her of which this
Scotch doctor approved. He came, she thought, merely to exercise his
abnormal habit of interference in other folks' affairs and to find
fault with her chosen manner of life. She had at first, in her desire
to be alone, not hesitated to tell him she preferred her own company
to any other. He had barked back that her taste was unnatural, and it
would take more than "a bitter-tongued lass" to drive him from his
duty. Questioned sarcastically as to what he conceived his duty to be,
he had replied solemnly, "To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> keep an eye on you, lass, and to see that
you come to no harm."</p>

<p>Furious as this gratuitous resolve to care for her had made the woman
who believed she could fend for herself in the world, his answer had
nevertheless brought the bitter tears to her angry eyes, so that she
could not find words for a retort. The doctor's intention to protect
the woman by no means made him lenient in his judgment of her; he
denounced her cut hair as outrageous; her men's clothes as disgraceful,
and her work in the field as against nature. She secretly enjoyed his
explosion of rage when she took service at Bar Q.</p>

<p>No lass, declared the doctor, in her sober senses would disfigure
herself by cutting off her head the hair that her Maker had planted
there. No true woman would wear a mon's clothes. Mere contact with a
wild brute like Bull Langdon would muddy any pure woman in the land.
Her obsession&mdash;which is what he termed her aversion to his own sex&mdash;and
her unnatural life alone was a pathological matter, for which she
needed to be treated as for the unfortunate illness she had contracted
in London. Some day, he warned her, she would thank him for the one
cure as well as for the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>She let him talk on, usually disdaining to answer, and she pursued her
way undeterred by his wholesale condemnation of her and her course of
life.</p>

<p>Yet Angella Loring, holding a little baby in her arms for the first
time in her life, and looking down with dewy eyes upon the small blonde
head resting so helplessly against her breast, could she have seen the
face of the country doctor as he looked at the cropped bent head, would
have known that all his thoughts of her were not wholly hard.</p>

<p>Glaring up at him to hide the impending tears, she almost surprised
that look of grave tenderness on the rough face of the man who had
known her as a child.</p>

<p>"She doesn't want it," said Angella Loring. "Her own child! Well, then,
I'll keep it! It shan't want. I'll care for it."</p>

<p>"It's a wee laddie&mdash;born before its time, and nane too strong." He had
a habit when unduly moved of lapsing into Gaelic, and what he muttered
was unintelligible to the woman, wholly taken up with the baby in her
arms. Could she have understood him she would have heard the doctor say
that a woman who could mother another woman's "bairn" would be a good
mother to her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Outside the snow was still heavily falling. Great mounds were piling up
on all sides. That world of snow might have appalled the stranger, but
to the farmer it meant certain moisture in the soil. A spring snowstorm
was even more desirable for the land than rain, as it melted gradually
into the earth. Already the sun was gleaming through the falling
snowflakes, and the intense cold had abated.</p>

<p>"Weel, weel, I'll be off for a while, lass. There's much still to
attend to."</p>

<p>"You can't go out in that storm," said Angella roughly. "Wait, I'll get
you something to eat. Not even your Ford could plow through snow like
that."</p>

<p>"Maybe not, and I'll not be taking the Ford."</p>

<p>"Well, I've no vehicle to lend you."</p>

<p>"I'll go afoot," said the doctor, wrapping his woolen scarf about his
neck, preparatory to going out.</p>

<p>"You're a fool to go out," said Angella crossly. "Wait till you have a
cup of coffee anyway."</p>

<p>"I'll be going just across the land, to the lad's cabin. I heard last
night that he was back."</p>

<p>"Who's cabin? What land?"</p>

<p>"Young Cyril Stanley's&mdash;the scallawag. I'll have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> thot to say to him,
I'm thinking, will bring him across in a hurry."</p>

<p>"He needn't come here!" Angella had started up savagely. "I don't want
any man here, least of all a dog like that who'd do such a thing to a
girl. He can keep away from <i>my</i> house. He's not fit to&mdash;to even look
at her now. No man is."</p>

<p>"Weel, weel, 'tis true, but we're all liable to mistakes, ma'am, and
young blood is hot and careless, and who are we&mdash;you and I&mdash;to judge
another? We must look to our own consciences first, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Yes, stand up for him&mdash;defend him. You men all hang together. I know
you all, and I hate you. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off, for the doctor was looking at her with such a strange
look of mingled earnestness and tenderness, that the stormy words died
on her lips, and she dropped her wet face upon the soft little one in
her arms.</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott closed the door softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>The tour of the Bar Q purebred bulls had been a disastrous and costly
one. From city to city, at a staggering expense, went the prize herd,
from which extraordinary things had been expected. Wherever they
touched it was their misfortune to be turned back or shunted farther
afield. That winter the country was suffering from the fearful scourge,
which having stricken down its victims by the thousands in Europe had
passed over the sea to America.</p>

<p>Then there was a time when the Bar Q herd was condemned by a harassed
and irritated authority who, upon the diagnosis of an incompetent
veterinary surgeon, pronounced the cattle to be suffering from foot and
mouth disease, and an order was issued for the slaughter of the entire
herd, and the burning of all sheds, cars or other houses in which they
had been penned. Bull Langdon found himself held indefinitely in the
States, as he fought by injunction proceedings the destruction of his
herd, which would have meant an incalculable loss&mdash;even ruin&mdash;to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The adjournments and delays, the long, drawn-out legal processes, kept
the herd in the States from December till February, and when at last
they were freed the penned-in brutes were in a deteriorated condition.
Their long confinement, the unaccustomed traveling, and the lack
of proper care, made the once smooth bulls difficult to handle and
dangerous, so that by the time the herd was ready to start back for
Canada more than one of the "hands" who had come to the States with
them deserted the outfit rather than risk looking after the uncertain
animals on tour.</p>

<p>Bull Langdon, raging and fretting over the enforced delays in the
States, harassed by his losses and his failure to obtain a showing of
the famous herd, was in a black mood when at last the outfit reached
Barstairs.</p>

<p>Here fresh trouble awaited him. Of all the bulls, the Prince had proved
the most dangerous and erratic of temper; his ceaseless bellowing and
attempts to break loose had done much to make the outfit unpopular
throughout their travels. Always uncertain and dangerous, back at
Barstairs he became well-nigh uncontrollable, and there was no "hand"
of the entire outfit, save Cyril, who dared approach the raging beast,
as behind heavily barred fences he ranged up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> restlessly,
calling his resounding cries to the cattle that he could smell even
if he could not see them in adjoining pastures, and something of the
wild spirit of the animal appealed to his owner, whose own pent-up rage
seemed to find vent in a savage roaring voice. A kindred spirit bound
them together. Often, when the exasperations of the tour threatened
to overwhelm him, he would go to where the Prince ranged up and down
within the narrow space of his shed bellowing and moaning his demands
for freedom. At such times Bull Langdon, from the other side of
the bars, would call to the bull, not soothingly, but in a tone of
encouragement, as though cheering and "rooting" for the rebellious
brute.</p>

<p>"Go to it!" he would snarl through the bars. "Let 'em know you're here!
Keep 'em awake. Make their nerves jump. Go to it, <i>bull</i>!"</p>

<p>Up to the time of their return to Barstairs, Cyril Stanley had looked
after the animal, and so long as he was at hand the Prince remained
fairly well under control. But Cyril, who had been silent and morose
all through the tour in the States, suddenly decided, once back in
Canada, to quit the outfit. The cattleman received his quiet request to
be relieved of his job with consternation and fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>What did he want to leave for? Hadn't he had his pay raised four times
already? Hadn't he got $500 he'd been promised? He had practically
full charge of the herd already, and the foreman's job and wages would
belong to him before spring.</p>

<p>But neither bluster nor curses moved him, and the offer of increases
in wages, heavy bonuses and enormous salary were steadily refused.
Money meant nothing now to Cyril. He was heartily sick of the whole
business. He felt the restlessness that comes to a man as soon as he
feels himself free again and on his native soil, and longs to be moving
along the trail. To roam from place to place seemed all that was left
to him since his dream of a home had been shattered, and long absence
had not cured him of the sickness of love. He had had enough of cattle.
He was done with ranching, and when the Bull demanded just what it was
that he proposed to do, he answered after a thoughtful pause: "Think
I'll hike for Bow Claire. Plenty of work there, I guess. The river'll
be high when the snows begin to melt, and they'll be wantin' 'hands'
and loggers at the camp."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bull Langdon found his hands full. Those were the days of
labor unrest when there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> a dozen employers in the employment
offices for every employee; when wages were soaring; when men
looked the "bosses" squarely in the face, and made their own terms.
The cattleman had returned at a time when labor was so scarce and
independent in Alberta, that many of the farmers were forced to do
their own work, or grub together with other farmers on shares. It is
certain that there was not a ranchman in the country willing to work
with Bull Langdon. Even those he had formerly been able to tyrannize
over gave him a wide berth; never had the Bar Q been so short-handed,
and the departure of Cyril, who was invaluable among the purebred, was
a real disaster to the Bull camp.</p>

<p>For some time Langdon had been beset with an almost insensate craving
for Nettie Day. All the time he had been in the States she had never
been wholly absent from his mind, though the anxieties of the tour had
kept his desire for the girl in check; but once back in Canada, his
mind reverted to her incessantly.</p>

<p>As he stood watching Cyril Stanley disappear at a slow lope over the
hills, it occurred to him that he might be making for Bar Q and Nettie,
and the thought gave him pause. The idea that Nettie and Cyril should
come together again was more than he could stand. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> blood rushed
madly to his head, and everything went red before his eyes.</p>

<p>Batt Leeson, a hand who had served directly under Cyril, was the
second-best upon the place; he could be trusted to look after the
cattle, and was known to be a conscientious workman, although he had
never yet been entrusted with any position of authority. When Cyril's
job was offered him, therefore, he was rather afraid and hesitant.
However, there was no foreman at this time at the Bull camp, which had
been stripped for the trip to the States, and there was no other man in
the outfit fit to be one.</p>

<p>The Bull considered the possibility of Cyril's changing his mind and
returning to Bar Q. He knew what logging in the lumber camps meant, and
that though the work would not daunt the young man, the food and the
dirt would. The daily association with them "damn dirty forriners," as
Bull named the Russian loggers, would soon be too much for a white man,
he decided, and counted upon Cyril's return.</p>

<p>When he left the camp he was by no means easy in his mind about his
cattle. He took the trail for Bar Q in his big car, racing ahead in the
teeth of a veritable cyclone, but the good car held its straight course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>gallantly. It was late at night when Bull Langdon reached the ranch in
the foothills, and the noise of his arrival could not be heard above
the gale. When he saw that light in the kitchen, he came warily upon
the place. Sniffing the air like a bloodhound tracking down his prey,
he cautiously approached the kitchen where Nettie's light still burned.
Concealed in the darkness of the living room his greedy eyes devoured
the girl as she moved about the room busy at the great range. All
thought was swept from his mind, leaving only the mad desire to crush
in his arms once again the girl who awakened in him this overmastering
passion.</p>

<p class="space-above">Meanwhile, Cyril Stanley had mechanically turned his horse's head
toward the foothills. He had no definite purpose in mind; he was
vaguely conscious of being hungry for a sight of Nettie. His long
absence had not cured him; he loved the girl as deeply as on that first
day when their eyes had met across the space of the poor D. D. D.
shack, and the room was full of laughter.</p>

<p>How pretty she had looked, in spite of her shabby dress; how her hair
had shone in the sun! How gentle and sweet and good she had been to
her little brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> and sisters! Even the strange woman in the C. P.
R. shack had melted before Nettie's shy effort to help her in those
days, reflected the unhappy Cyril. No one could have resisted her, and
he told himself that it was small wonder that he had "fallen so hard"
for her. He had seen many women in the big cities of America, but had
found no face like Nettie's. No, he wouldn't change <i>his</i> girl for any
girl in the States. And as in his thought he called her "his," he awoke
suddenly to the realization that Nettie was "his" no longer; someone
had stolen her heart from him! Yet such a longing was on him to see the
beloved face again, that he resolved to risk her displeasure by going
to Bar Q before burying himself in the deep woods at the lumber camp.</p>

<p>On the road he fell in with a couple of riders from the hill country,
and their suggestive gossip aroused him somewhat from his gloom, for he
caught the girl's name and the sneer that came into their voices caused
him to sit up abruptly, his hat pushed back, and his eyes full of
dangerous interrogation. They protested they had only been "stringing"
him, and rode rapidly off. What they had hinted was that the quicker
the girl at Bar Q was married, the better, and that he, Cyril Stanley,
had come back only just in time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Cyril turned this over heavily in his mind, shaking his head as though
the problem were beyond him, but he changed his course away from the
hill, deciding to spend a few days at his homestead. He would stay in
the little house he had built for Nettie; he wanted to look over the
place that was to have been their home. He would go to Bar Q later. At
least, Nettie would not refuse to bid him good-by.</p>

<p>As he rode along, his hat over his eyes, smarting tears bit at the
lids, and the heart of the lad who used once to go singing along the
trail and about his work was heavy as lead within him.</p>

<p>At the homely little cabin, faith and confidence in Nettie seemed
to come back to him; perhaps her strange behavior had all been some
hideous mistake. Perhaps she had been merely angry at his going to
Barstairs. Well, a girl had a right to be angry, and maybe she had
gotten over it by now. There was no accounting for a girl's moods, he
reasoned; he "wasn't no saint himself" to hold anything against her.
If only Nettie would smile at him again he would forget all he had
suffered during all those cruel months. If only she would look at him
and speak to him as she used to do. Nettie! <i>His</i> girl! His own, out
of all the world. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> had been love at first sight; so much they had
always agreed on, and she had been fond of repeating that it was also
a love that would never die. She had meant it then, as they sat hand
in hand amongst the berry bushes, with the evening sunlight on the
tree-tops glistening like moon rays on the whispering leaves.</p>

<p>The longer Cyril stayed there gazing around the cabin that was filled
with things Nettie herself had helped him to make, the stronger grew
his hope and faith. A new exhilaration suddenly possessed him, making
him feel that life was worth living again. He looked with a new warmth
and kindness upon the world, and not even the slowly gathering storm
that darkened the March day could quell his mounting spirits.</p>

<p>He was whistling and bustling about the shack when he heard a hanging
upon the door, and opened the door to find Dr. McDermott standing
there. He greeted his old friend with unaffected delight, for the
doctor was always associated in his thoughts with Nettie, whom he had
brought into the world in the best day's work he ever accomplished, so
thought Cyril.</p>

<p>"Hello, doc. Gee, it's great to see your good old mug again. How'd you
know I was back? How're you?"</p>

<p>But the old doctor was scowling at him like an angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> bulldog,
underlip thrust out, and his face puckered into lines of unmistakable
disapproval; worse still, he was pointedly refusing Cyril's proffered
handshake.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said, "I'll not shake hands with a scallawag. Not till
he's done the right thing, by gad!"</p>

<p>"Wow, doc! What's bitin' you?"</p>

<p>"Lad," said Dr. McDermott sternly, "I'm not here on any pleasure call.
I've come as a matter of duty, mon to mon to ask&mdash;to demand&mdash;that you
do the right thing by that puir lass."</p>

<p>"Lass? Who do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You know domned well who I mean. None other, mon, but Nettie Day."</p>

<p>At the mention of that name Cyril's face turned suddenly gray and stern.</p>

<p>"There are certain things I don't discuss with no man, doc. One of
them's&mdash;Nettie. I don't let no man talk to me about <i>her</i>. Some coyotes
on the road stopped me, and started to blat some stuff about her, but
they shut up tight enough and gave me the heels of their broncs before
they'd barely got started with that line of talk. And I ain't lettin'
even an old friend like you say anything about Nettie. What's fallen
between her and me is our affair."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. McDermott's fist came heavily down upon the table.</p>

<p>"Lad, ye're going to marry that girl, if I have to shove you by your
neck to the parson."</p>

<p>A light flamed in the boy's face; his eyes widened as he stared
incredulously at the doctor.</p>

<p>"I say," he said, all but weeping for joy, "that's a good joke on me.
Is <i>that</i> what you're drivin' at, doc? Marry her! Say, I'd marry Nettie
Day this blessed minute if she'd have me!"</p>

<p>"Very good, lad. You'll have your chance. I've got her now at Miss
Loring's. I'll go myself after the missionary, if you'll lend me a
horse. Trail's not fit for a car. I'll do my best to get back first
thing in the morning. Meanwhile, you'll have a chance to get your house
in shape. You'll want it to shine for that wife and baby of yours."</p>

<p>"That wi&mdash;and&mdash; Say, what's the joke, anyway?"</p>

<p>The doctor was now in better humor. His errand had been highly
successful, and after all a lad was only a lad, and he liked young
Cyril Stanley. There was good stuff in Cyril&mdash;good Scotch stuff.</p>

<p>Cyril, taking the doctor's remark for one of the coarse jokes commonly
cracked in that countryside at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> the time of a wedding, laughed
half-heartedly, but the words stuck queerly in his mind. To change the
subject, he said:</p>

<p>"Doc, what do you suppose ever possessed Nettie to treat me as she
did? When I got back from Barstairs&mdash;let me see, that was last
October&mdash;no, a bit before that&mdash;What does she do but run away from me,
and when I chased after her, she turned me down dead cold. Said she'd
changed&mdash;wasn't the same, and a&mdash;and&mdash;she simply sent me packing&mdash;made
me think someone'd cut me out with her and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cyril broke off. The memory of that time was still an open wound in his
mind.</p>

<p>"I don't blame her a bit," blustered the doctor, in assumed anger.
"If it wasn't for that baby now, she'd do better to send you packing
altogether. What's the matter with you young people today? Can't you
hold back like respectable folk? Don't you realize that even though
you marry the gell now, she'll always be branded with the shame of
this thing; and it's not only the lass to be considered, there's the
innocent child&mdash;the baby to consider."</p>

<p>"That's the third or fourth time that you've said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> that word. What do
you mean, anyway? What baby? Whose?"</p>

<p>"Whose? Why, your own, lad&mdash;yours and Nettie's."</p>

<p>"Mine and&mdash;Have you gone plumb crazy, doc?"</p>

<p>"Not I, lad. I helped bring your child into the world this morning, and
Nettie's resting quiet now, and waiting for you, I have no doubt. Now,
lad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off, for something in the look and motion of Cyril Stanley
stopped him from further reproach.</p>

<p>"I've no intention of being hard on you. Young blood&mdash;is&mdash;young blood,
and I was young myself once."</p>

<p>Cyril had staggered back, like one mortally struck. Slowly the truth
had dawned upon him, and with the realization that Nettie had been
false to him, something primitive and furious seemed to shake the
foundations of his being; something that was made up of outrage and
ungodly hatred.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;she's&mdash;got&mdash;a baby, has she?"</p>

<p>"A wee lad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you come to me&mdash;to <i>me</i> to get a name for it!"</p>

<p>"To you? Who else?"</p>

<p>"Who else?" jeered the lad frantically. "Ask <i>her</i>!"</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott recoiled before the savage glare in the young man's
eyes, and slowly he began to realize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> the truth. He was stunned by the
thought that another man than Cyril had been the cause of the girl's
downfall. Who could it be? Slowly he turned the matter over in his
mind, rejecting one by one each of the possible men he could think of,
till at last the great sinister figure of the Bull loomed up before
his mind's eye. He began clearly to recall a certain day at Bar Q when
he had caught the evil expression of the cowman's face as, behind his
wife's back, he followed Nettie Day with his greedy, covetous eyes.</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott's shoulders seemed to bend as if a great burden lay upon
them, and he looked long and searchingly at the furious boy before him.
When he spoke his voice was shaken with emotion.</p>

<p>"The Lord help you, lad!" he said. "The Lord help us all in our deep
trouble. Give us sober and humble hearts. Teach us to bear as best we
can the iniquities of the wicked who beset us. Amen."</p>

<p>The sound of the door closing fell like a lash on Cyril Stanley's
brain. Alone with his frenzy and despair, he looked wildly round as if
to find some outlet for his feelings. A great ax lay on the floor near
the out-kitchen door, and the young man seized it and swung it high in
his hand. It crashed down upon the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> splintering it in two. Again
and again the ax descended until everything he had bought for Nettie
Day lay in fragments about the room. Then he took from the storeroom a
five-gallon can of kerosene, and emptied it deliberately over the floor.</p>

<p>He put on chapps, sheepskin, fur cap and spurs, tied up a few other
necessaries in a bundle and walked heavily to the door. Outside, he
smashed the windows and a gale of snow flew into the wrecked house.
Lastly, he struck a match and, guarding the flame, he knelt in the
doorway and threw it into a pool of kerosene.</p>

<p>The flames around the floor crept like snakes, then leaped up the
walls, and from the piles of broken chairs and tables went roaring to
the roof.</p>

<p>The house went up in a furious blaze. Long after Cyril Stanley had
disappeared into the great timber country the smoke of his burning
homestead rose above the blanket of snow, until the smoldering ruins
were buried under the soft whiteness and covered from the eyes of the
world. But later on the sunshine of the spring would melt the shroud
away and reveal where his love lay ruined on the prairie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>Spring came late to Alberta that year, and it was May before the
farmers were upon the land.</p>

<p>Zero weather followed the heavy March snowfalls, and May was well
advanced before the first thaw began.</p>

<p>Angella Loring was particularly anxious that year to be upon her land
early, for she wished to keep Nettie with her, and had conceived an
ambitious scheme which she believed would tempt the girl to remain.
Ever since her recovery Nettie had been waiting for the weather to
break, so that she might go to Calgary and try to find work there,
where she would be unknown, and Dr. McDermott had told her how great
was the scarcity of help in the city. Angella, from the first day,
had taken charge of the baby, and indeed it might have been her child
rather than Nettie's. For Nettie was afraid of this child of the
Bull's. Before the cold spell had broken, and while she was still weak,
she would sit at the window and stare out over the bleak landscape
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> unseeing eyes. Spring is always an unpleasant season in Alberta,
and that year it was even worse than usual. While Angella was away at
the barns or the fields busy with her work, Nettie found herself shut
in alone with her baby, but she never went near it, or attempted to
take it in her arms or caress it.</p>

<p>The child was undersized and frail, but it cried very little, and its
tiny, weird face looked curiously like a bird's. There was something
pitifully unfinished about it although it was in no way deformed. It
had simply been forced into the world before its time, and denied the
sustenance of its mother's breast&mdash;for Nettie was unable to nurse her
child&mdash;it made slow progress. At the end of April it weighed no more
than the day it was born.</p>

<p>If Nettie, immersed in her own sorrow, was oblivious of her child's
condition, its foster-mother was filled with alarm and anxiety. Dr.
McDermott was no longer an unwelcome visitor at the shack, indeed he
was often sent for when Jake, who had taken to haunting the ranch, and
sleeping in Cyril's deserted sheds, could be despatched upon such an
errand. No matter where he was, or what he was doing, the doctor seldom
failed to respond to Angella's summons. Tramping into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> shack,
stamping the snow off his feet, he would look with pretended fierceness
at the two women, looking for something to scold about and always,
finding it, but although his words were rough, his hands were gentle as
a mother's as he took the baby in his arms. He would gaze intently at
the little creature with all a parent's anxiety while its mother held
aloof, keeping her gaze riveted upon the window.</p>

<p>More than once, Angella Loring found herself very close to the doctor,
and looking up, he would see her eyes were misty with solicitude over
"her" baby. To cover his own feelings, he would ask her to fetch this
and that and she waited upon him meekly. Once kneeling by his side,
as the baby lay upon his knees, she saw its little wan face puckered
into something that she firmly declared was a smile. In her delight and
excitement she put her arms around the baby on his knee, and before she
realized what was happening she found her hand enclosed in the doctor's
warm clasp. Their eyes met, and the color slowly receded from her
cheeks.</p>

<p>That night, she went into the bedroom, carefully closing the burlap
curtain between it and the outer room, and searching amongst the
contents of the box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> she had brought with her from England, Angella
Loring found something that was no familiar object in that prairie
shack&mdash;a mirror&mdash;a woman's hand mirror, of tortoiseshell, with a silver
crest upon it. For some time she held it in her hand, face down, before
she mustered courage to lift it slowly to her face. For a long time
she gazed into the glass, the bright, haunted eyes slowly scanning the
strange face, with its crown of soft gray curls. She was kneeling on
the floor by her bed, and suddenly the hand holding the mirror fell
into her lap, and Angella Loring said in a choking whisper looking down
at her reflection, "I'm an old fool! God help me!"</p>

<p>Her program for that season was an ambitious one for a fragile woman;
she purposed to put in one hundred and fifty acres of crop, and to hay
over sixty more acres, and not content with working her own land, she
intended to work and seed Cyril's as well. This latter was the stake to
which she hoped to tie Nettie to her. She felt sure that the girl would
not fail to respond to this opportunity to help the man she loved, for
according to the homestead law of that time, land had to be fenced,
worked and lived upon for a certain term of years, and by abandoning
his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>homestead, Cyril stood to lose the quarter, besides the waste of
all the work and money already expended upon the place. When Angella
laid her proposition before Nettie, she was rewarded by the first sign
of animation the girl had shown since the doctor had brought her to
the ranch. Her apathy and despair fell from her, and when Angella told
her that unless Nettie would give her the help she needed she would
be obliged to employ hired hands which she could not afford, Nettie's
eagerness knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"Oh my, yes, Angel, I just wisht you'd give me the chance. I'd love to
do the work. I'll do it alone if&mdash;you'll let me&mdash;I'll work my fingers
to the bone to&mdash;to&mdash;make up to him&mdash;and to you, Angel."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I'm glad you feel that way, because I need your help
badly. I believe it's going to be a crop year anyway, because the snow
when it does melt is bound to mean all sorts of moisture for the land.
Meanwhile, we can do a bit of fencing. Mine need repairing badly, and
so do parts of Cyril's. We've got to cross fence between his pasture
land and where the crop is to go in. He's got quite a few head of
horses and cattle running loose, I see, and they've got to be driven
off the grain land. I'm going out after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> a couple of heavy horses of
his I saw the other day on his land. I think I can corral them, and
they'll come in first rate for the plow."</p>

<p>"Oh, Angel, let me go. I understand horses better'n you do. It's awful
hard to drive them when they've been loose like that all winter. So let
me go along."</p>

<p>"You'll stay right here. Look here, now, <i>I'm</i> going to run things
here, and you do as you're told."</p>

<p>"Well, don't forget to take a halter, will you, and Angel, you want to
keep away from their hind feet&mdash;even if you are on horse. Sometimes
they kick right out. Dad was lamed that way, drivin' in wild horses.
Got kicked while on horse-back, right in the shin. My, it was awful!"</p>

<p>"I'm all right. Don't you worry about me," said Angella. "Mind the baby
while I'm gone, and look here, if he cries, there's barley gruel in
that bottle. Heat it by standing it in hot water&mdash;but don't let it get
too hot. I think he'll be all right till I get back."</p>

<p>Nettie did a curious thing that day when Angella had left her alone.
She went over to the rough cot that Angella had made out of a grocery
box for the baby, and for a long time she stood looking down at the
little sleeper. Almost unconsciously her hand touched her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> baby's
tiny hand that clung at once to her finger and at that warm contact a
flood of emotion overwhelmed Nettie's heart. It was as if tentacles
had reached out and fastened upon her very soul; the little curled up
fist seemed to scorch her with its mute reproach and appeal for her
affection. Nettie pulled her hand fiercely away, and fled into the
adjoining room, her breath coming and going tumultuously.</p>

<p>"I don't want to love him," she cried. "I don't want to. He's <i>his</i>,
and I wisht I'd died before I&mdash;I&mdash;come to this."</p>

<p>Seeking some physical outlet for her pent-up feelings she looked about
her, and saw a pair of scissors on Angella's dressing table. A moment
later she found herself slashing into her long hair. The heavy blonde
braids dropped to the floor with a soft thud. Nettie, shorn of her
beautiful hair, was not, however, disfigured, in fact her childlike,
simple beauty seemed almost lovelier for the cropped head, accentuating
her extreme youth. But when Angella coming in stopped on the threshold
and stared at her condemningly, Nettie knew that she had done wrong.</p>

<p>"Nettie Day, what you have done is an act of sheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> vandalism," said
the woman, who herself had cut her own hair to the scalp.</p>

<p>"Oh, Angel, I wanted to be like you. I didn't want no more to be like a
woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Angella's face paled.</p>

<p>"So I am not like a woman, then?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that, Angel. You're more like a woman in your heart
than anyone I ever knew, 'cept Mrs. Langdon, and I just wanted to make
myself so that&mdash;so that no one would ever want to look at me again.
Just 's if I was same as a man and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I suppose you think you've succeeded," said Angella dryly. "Never
fear. It will take more than the cutting of your hair to keep men from
you, Nettie Day. However, it's your own hair, and I suppose you meant
all right. They say 'Hell is paved with good intentions.' But you
needn't think that because I&mdash;was fool enough to&mdash;to&mdash;make a freak of
myself, that I approve of you or anyone else doing it."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Angel. I'm awfully sorry. I&mdash;I want to be as much like you
as I can be. I want to wear them men's overalls too and do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As for the overalls, that's all right, <i>they're</i> sensible; but, look
here, Nettie, don't let me catch you doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> anything like that to
disfigure yourself again, and don't you go slashing any more into your
hair. It doesn't look bad now, but even you would look a fright if you
had cut it as I did&mdash;right to the scalp."</p>

<p>"It's growing in now. And it looks&mdash;right pretty, Angel," said Nettie
wistfully. "D'you know, you ain't nearly as ugly as you think you are,"
she added with girlish navet, which brought a chuckle from Angella,
warming the baby's bottle at the stove.</p>

<p class="space-above">They began to fence in mid-April. The ground was hard, and having no
proper hole diggers they were at a still greater disadvantage. However,
Angella said she did not want to waste any time on repairing fences,
once the land was ready for the crop. Cyril's quarter was already
fairly well fenced, but the dividing line between the two quarters had
never been completed. Now that the two places were to be worked as one
the line-fence had become unnecessary. By persistent labor upon their
first task of the season, they achieved an inadequate protection for
the proposed crop. The uneven line of barbed wire, set on unsteady
posts, aroused the derisive condemnation of Dr. McDermott, who warned
them that cattle would have no trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> in breaking through and that
the two wires did not constitute a legal fence, three being the
required number. Angella, colder and more unbending than ever in her
attitude to the doctor, rejoined that "they would take their chances
this year."</p>

<p>The herd law was in force, and it was against the law for cattle to
be at large on the road or road allowances in that particular part
of the country. The doctor grouchily warned them that that concerned
stray cattle, but there was absolutely nothing to prevent a herd driven
by riders from going through. Nothing, returned Angella indignantly,
except the fact that reputable riders had a professional sense of
honor, so far as other people's grain fields were concerned, and she
knew none that would be likely to turn driven cattle into a grain
field. Such things were not done in a country like Alberta. Besides,
cattle were unlikely to be moved in the summer time, and by the fall,
the harvest would be in, and the grain safe.</p>

<p>"Have it your way," returned the doctor. "But if you want to do a mon's
work, you ought to do it in a mon's way." This gratuitous remark was
received in the disdainful silence it deserved.</p>

<p>They had a truly gigantic task before them, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> putting in of over one
hundred and fifty acres of grain&mdash;flax, barley, oats, wheat, green feed
and rye.</p>

<p>As soon as the land was in condition to be worked, they began. For
days they had been sorting over and mending harnesses and bridles,
sharpening the implements and getting everything into shape. Eight work
horses had been brought up from the pasture, and for a few days had
been fed oats and given especial care. Nettie had regained her strength
and was invaluable to the less experienced, though self-reliant Angella
because of her long familiarity with farm work and horses too.</p>

<p>The baby went into the field with them, carried in a large box, where
among its pillows, Nettie's child slept in blissful unconsciousness of
the tragedy of his existence. In the latter weeks he had been gaining
strength, and his roving blue eyes had smiled more than once at the
adoring Angella.</p>

<p>Nettie went on the plow, the hardest of the implements to ride. There
had been some argument between the girls as to which implement each
should ride, Angella contending that Nettie was not yet in a fit
condition to stand the rough shaking on the plow; and Nettie stubbornly
insisting that she felt "strong as an ox," and that she had ridden the
plow since she was a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> girl. "Dad put me into the field when I
was just ten," she told Angella. "You know he couldn't afford to stay
home to work our quarter, because our land was so poor; he had to go
out on other farms to make some wages, because we was such a hungry
family, and it took sights of food to fill us all."</p>

<p>So Nettie rode the plow, and then the disc, while Angella took the
harrow and the seeder. Angella only yielded the plow to Nettie when
the girl pointed out that the seeder required "brains," of which she
sadly admitted she had little. She had never seeded, not even at home;
Dad had always come back in time to do that. So Angella, feeling the
importance of her two seasons' experience in seeding, argued no more,
and, seeded six inches deep, a precautionary measure, she told Nettie,
against a dry year. The weather favored them; intermittent rains and
flurries of snow kept the ground damp enough for fertilization, but not
too wet for sowing. Nevertheless, said Angella, you never could tell
about Alberta's climate. Drought might start with June, and then where
would the careless farmers be?</p>

<p>This period of hard work diverted Nettie's mind from its obsession of
sorrow; for mind and body are alike exhausted at the end of a day from
sunrise to sunset.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> Intent upon being a first-rate helper, her mind
ceased to dwell upon her troubles.</p>

<p>Having finished the preparation of the ground and the seeding, they
spent the next few weeks bringing their few head of stock to the
corrals and all alone they branded, dehorned and vaccinated them
against blackleg. Nettie then went over to Cyril's quarter with the
plow and broke new land, by no means an easy job, since the ground was
rough virgin soil, where rocks and bushes and tree stumps abounded.
Meanwhile Angella summer fallowed on her own quarter.</p>

<p>July came in on a wave of intense heat. There was haying to be done
on Cyril's quarter; Angella's fields had been overpastured, and she
proposed to let them lie fallow for that year. The two girls put up
seventy-five tons of hay. Angella was on the rake, an easy implement
to ride, Nettie on the mower. Then Angella ascended the buck, and
Nettie did the stacking, and as the big golden pile grew from day to
day under their hands, their pride and satisfaction in their work was
great. Angella felt that she had something to show for her work at last
and pinned her faith upon a sure crop&mdash;the first since her arrival in
Alberta.</p>

<p>Before and after their field work, they had plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> chores and
housework to do. Nettie milked, looked after the sitting hens and
spring chicks, and the great sow with her litter; she watered and
fed the horses and cleaned the barns and stables. Meanwhile, Angella
prepared the meals, made the butter, cleaned the house, and took full
charge of the baby.</p>

<p>In Nettie's avoidance of her child there was fear rather than aversion.
This child that had been forced upon her by the man she hated aroused
strange tumults within her. At the thought of its father, she would
shudder and tell herself she hated it because it was his; but there
were moments when melting, passionate impulses consumed her, and then
it took all her strength not to snatch her baby up and clasp it tightly
to her breast.</p>

<p>Throughout the long day she sat on the hard seat of the implement,
rocked and shaken from side to side, as the four-horse plow broke up
the rough land, and she tried hard to keep her mind upon her work. As
her expert hand guided her horses, making a clean, workmanlike job
of which not even a man could have been ashamed, she found a certain
comfort in the thought that she was working for Cyril Stanley. Yet, as
the implement swept on its circular path over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> field, each time it
passed near the box beside the straw stack where the baby slept, a sob
of anguish would tear her heart anew.</p>

<p>The harvest was close at hand, and for the first time since she had
come to Alberta, Angella Loring was to have a crop.</p>

<p>Billowing waves of golden wheat, going forty bushels or more to the
acre, lay spread out before her, barley, glistening, and silvery, oats
as tall as a man and thick and heavy, the grain, like living creatures,
stirring and murmuring drowsily in the sunshine as the warm wind passed
over it.</p>

<p>"Come, we are waiting to be reaped," it seemed to chant. "Gather us in,
before the cold breath of the northland shall come shivering over the
land, and freeze our strength with the touch of its icy finger."</p>

<p>Their labors over the two women who had put in the crop would walk
slowly in the cool of the day through the grain, and the soft swishing
of their skirts brushing a pathway through the thick grain sounded like
a whisper of peace in the quiet evening. The marvelous harvest moon
hung like a great orange ball above the fields; the prairie land seemed
to stretch illimitably into the distance; the far horizons disappeared
into a chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> of white hills, rising like a mist against the sky still
resplendent with the incomparable prairie sunset.</p>

<p>They talked little for the one was shy and reticent by nature, and in
the other reticence and brevity of speech had become a habit. Yet each
felt and understood the thought of the other, as they looked across at
the moving grain, which was the visible sign of their long and arduous
labor.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p>There was hail in the south and further west; it zigzagged across the
country, beating down the tall grain; the stones lay as big as eggs
upon the ground, breaking windows and lashing in its vindictive fury
whatever stood in its path. The grain shuddered beneath the onslaught
and bent to the ground. An angry black cloud overspread the sky like
a gigantic hand from whose outstretched fingers the hail was falling.
Not a stalk was left standing in the fields over which the storm
passed, but its course was curiously eccentric. It ignored whole
municipalities, and no one could tell where next it would choose to
vent its wicked rage. Anxiously the girls had watched the path of the
mad cloud, taking count of the destructive force that was wreaking
such havoc upon the grain lands. Nettie prayed&mdash;prayed to the God of
whom she knew so pitifully little, but to whom Mrs. Langdon had been
so near, and begged that their fields, Angela's and Cyril's, might be
spared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>The rural telephone wires were busy all that day and evening, with the
calls of the excited farmers.</p>

<p>"Were you struck?"</p>

<p>"Yes, wiped out."</p>

<p>"Insured?"</p>

<p>"Not a red cent."</p>

<p>"Gosh, I'm sorry. There's not a spear left in my fields neither, but I
got ten dollars on the acre."</p>

<p>"Think they'll allow you one hundred per cent. loss?"</p>

<p>"Sure they will."</p>

<p>"Hm! Betcha you'll thresh just the same."</p>

<p>Then the bang of a hanging up receiver; but the ceaseless buzzing went
on, with all the other parties on the main wire listening in, gloating
or commiserating over each others' misfortunes.</p>

<p>"How about Smither's?"</p>

<p>"Say, his fields aren't touched."</p>

<p>"You don't say. Isn't it the devil how them hail storms skip and miss."</p>

<p>"Munsun's got wiped off the map. So did Homan."</p>

<p>"Pederson's ain't touched even."</p>

<p>"Trust them Swedes to have the luck every time."</p>

<p>"Did you hear about Bar Q?"</p>

<p>"No, what?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heard they got it hardest of all. My land! There isn't a field the
hail didn't get. The whole three thousand acres on the grain ranch. I
see where his nibs won't do much threshing this year."</p>

<p>"He should worry. You can bet your bottom dollar he's got double
insurance on his crop, and, say, anyway, he'll have a sight of green
feed for his cattle. They say he's short of hay in the hill country
this year. I'll bet he cuts the hailed stuff for feed."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wonder!"</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>As it happened, Nettie and Angella's crops were among the few that had
escaped untouched. When the storm had passed and the sun blazed out
again over the battered fields there, strong and sturdy, shining in the
clear light, the grain they had sown seemed to smile at them and call
aloud to be reaped without further delay.</p>

<p>It was now mid-August, and the grain was ripe. Angella rode the binder,
a picturesque implement with canvas wings, which when in operation
resembles a sort of flying machine. Nettie followed on foot, stooking.
This was a man's job, for the sheaves of grain were heavy, and it was
no easy matter to bend and grasp the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> thick bundles and stook them in
stacks; but Nettie was strong and willing. She even tried to keep pace
with the binder, by running to the stacks, until Angella brought up her
horses sharply and refused to go on with the work, unless Nettie took
her time about the stooking.</p>

<p>The harvest occupied three long weeks, but the day came at last when
the work was all completed. There was no longer any danger of frost,
hail or drought. Nothing remained to be done but the threshing. Under
the mellow evening light that suffuses the Alberta country at the
harvest season, the girls, having gleaned bravely and well, rode in
from their last day of harvesting.</p>

<p>Sound carries far in the prairie country, and they could hear
distinctly the buzz of the threshing machine eight miles away, droning
like a comfortable bee, working steadily through the night. In a
few days, the threshers would "pull in" to Angella's ranch and the
harvested grain would be poured into the temporary granaries that they
had constructed from a portion of the barn.</p>

<p>As they stood together in the twilight, looking across at the harvest
field, they felt, though they might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> have been able to express
their thoughts in words, that they had made of that land of theirs
a picture no human brush could ever copy. And as this thought came
simultaneously to their minds, their eyes met, and they smiled at each
other like sisters. As they turned reluctantly from the contemplation
of their masterpiece, Nettie's last glance toward the hills saw the
figure of a rider silhouetted against the skyline. On his first
appearance at the top of the grade, she did not recognize him, but as
he approached, an uncontrollable agitation shook her from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Angel! Look&mdash;look&mdash;look&mdash;look&mdash;it's&mdash;the Bull! Oh&mdash;h&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have nothing to fear, Nettie. Nettie!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Angel, he's come for me! I knowed he would! I've been lookin' for
him, dreadin' it and now he's here. Oh, what am I to do? Where can I
hide?"</p>

<p>As on the night when the Bull had trapped her in her room and she had
listened paralyzed with fear to the breaking down of her door, her eyes
darted wildly about for a means of escape. This time, instead of the
narrow room, the whole of the far-flung prairie lay before her with the
great grain stocks which she herself had piled together. She broke from
Angella's grasp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> and fled across the field, and darting from one stack
to another, crouched down in despair behind the farthest one.</p>

<p>Angella made no movement to stop the fleeing girl. Her eyes narrowed
slightly as she gazed keenly at the man to discover whether it was
indeed Bull Langdon; then she turned and quietly went into her house.
She put the child in its basket into the inner room, and took down her
rifle; the rifle her neighbors in the early days had jeered at but
learned to respect. Angella did not load it in the house, but slowly
and calmly as Bull Langdon rode up she fitted the bullets in place.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p>In a country like Alberta, especially in the ranching sections, it is
not difficult for a person to disappear, if he is so minded.</p>

<p>Nettie had lived several months with Angella Loring before her
presence there was discovered. On one side of Angella's quarter was a
municipality of open range, and on the other, Cyril Stanley's quarter
section. Beyond Cyril's ranch was bush stretching for several miles to
the Elbow River that intersected, south and north, the land towards the
foothills fifty miles out of which was the Bar Q hill ranch. Beyond
this dense timber land began, and in its very heart stood the Bow
Claire Lumber Camp on the banks of the Ghost and Bow Rivers. Past the
timber land the foothills still continued, growing higher and higher
till they merged into the chain of Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Gossip about Nettie Day had been confined to the foothill ranching
country. Her story had run from ranch to ranch, and the general comment
was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>expressed in the customary country phrases of: "I never would
have believed it" or "I told you so." But Nettie disappeared from
the foothills, and curiosity, in a ranching country as has been said
above, is short-lived. Besides, the death of Mrs. Langdon provided
the ranchers with fresh excitement, and questions as to Nettie's
whereabouts were rarely heard.</p>

<p>At this time new cares had begun to take possession of the country
people of Alberta. Even as early as the spring, strange symptoms of
unrest might have been observed, and here and there fear seemed to
look out of the ranchers' eyes. Strange stories were percolating into
the ranches of sickness in the cities, a certain sickness which the
authorities purposely misnamed in order that the danger of panic might
be averted. The ranch people stuck closely to their homes that spring
and summer and were not cordial to strangers or of the usually welcome
regular visitors from the city&mdash;the insurance and real estate men, the
drug seller and the sly affable stranger who sold his Pain Killer to
the hands with a wink. All these "paper-collar dudes" as the farmers
called them, and the motor hoboes and camp-tramps, who stopped at
the ranches to ask for anything from a measure of milk to a night's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>lodging, experienced that summer a cold reception, for the ranch
people were shrewd enough to appreciate the fact that the plague might
be carried to them through just such mediums as these. So they stuck
close to home, and although the papers were filled with scare-head
accounts of the fearful scourge in the east, Alberta believed or hoped
it would prove immune.</p>

<p>In Yankee Valley, no one knew that the girl from the D. D. D. had
returned, or that, with her child, she had found a refuge in the
home of the Englishwoman who preferred to live like a hermit rather
than accept the friendship of her neighbors. Angella's land lay well
back from the main road and trails and there Nettie had found a true
sanctuary. One day, Batt Leeson, who had taken Cyril's place at the
Bull camp, was riding by Cyril's quarter, en route to the foothills
and paused at the sight of a girl in a man's blue overalls, driving a
six-horse plow team over new breaking.</p>

<p>Nettie, at a pause in the harvesting, while they were waiting for a
field of oats to ripen, was filling in the time by breaking new land on
Cyril's quarter.</p>

<p>Batt, gazing at her with his mouth open and his eyes blinking
incredulously, could not believe it possible. To make doubly sure, he
rode close to the fence line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> and from behind the shelter of a tree,
he waited for the plow to make its next round of the field. On and
on it came, its dull rumble and clatter of iron the louder for the
stillness of the prairie. Over a piece of rising ground came Nettie Day
upon the implement. Her head was bare, and her hair shone red-gold in
the sunshine, seeming to radiate light like a halo. It had been cropped
close as a boy's, and the gentle wind lifted and blew it back from her
flushed face as she drove.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be switched!" said the ranch hand.</p>

<p>He was, in fact, overjoyed at his discovery and would go back to the
foothills with a rich morsel of news. He imagined himself saying, "What
d'you think? That there girl that got into trouble at Bar Q is workin'
on the land of the fellow that&mdash;" Once Cyril Stanley had punched his
face for a much slighter offense than mentioning his (Cyril's) name in
connection with a girl, and Batt hit his tongue upon the name of the
man he suspected as the cause of Nettie Day's downfall.</p>

<p>Chuckling with satisfaction, he followed the girl with his gloating
eyes, but she was looking straight ahead and never turned her head to
where the rider watched her from the trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Things had been going from bad to worse at Bar Q. More than the usual
number of calves had died from blackleg, and a number of first-class
heifers had perished in the woods where the larkspur poison weed grew
wild. A Government veterinary surgeon, after a hurried survey of the
animals on the home range, had put a blanket quarantine on all the
cattle, which prevented their removal for months&mdash;in fact, until the
"vet" gave them a clean bill of health.</p>

<p>The cowman's stock and ranch had been badly neglected in his absence.
His cattle had been allowed to go at large; the fences were out of
repair and the customary careful segregation of each different grade
was a thing of the past. He found the whole ranch at sixes and sevens,
and raged at the foremen for their neglect, swearing that not "a stitch
of work" had been done all the time he had been away. He celebrated
his return by "firing" all hands at the foothill ranch, and the new
outfit who took their places proved worse than the old. Their term at
the ranch was soon over, and the constant changing of hands that now
began had an exceedingly bad effect upon the place. Good help was very
scarce at that time, and wages had been as high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> as one hundred dollars
a month with board, so Bull Langdon had his hands full at Bar Q.</p>

<p>He went about in a state of chronic evil humor in these days, and found
nothing about the place to suit him. Without his wife, the big ranch
house got upon his nerves, for with the genius of the born home-maker
she had created an atmosphere of comfort and peace that had made it
impressive even on her husband's insensitive mind. She had catered to
his appetite and his whims, and he had become used to having a woman's
tender care about him; indeed, he had grown to depend upon the very
services he had so roughly rewarded in the past. He could neither
accustom himself to the empty house not endure the meals at the cook
car.</p>

<p>In these days he slept on the ground floor of the house, in the dining
room. During his wife's lifetime the room had shone with orderliness
and cleanliness; now boots, rough coats and trousers, shirts, and the
cattlemen's riding accessories were strewn all over it, while the
unmade bed, the unwashed pots and pans, the traces of muddy boots
upon the floor, and the dust of weeks had turned it into a place of
indescribable dirt and confusion.</p>

<p>The Bull had refused to sleep upstairs since his wife's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> death; her
bedroom door remained closed. Nettie's, too, still hung on its broken
hinges, and sometimes on a windy night the knocking of that broken
door, screeching and swinging upon its single hinge, was more than
the overwrought cattleman could stand, and he would tramp out to the
bunkhouse, and sleep there instead. He felt the need of his home more
and more, however, and like a spoiled child whose favorite toy had been
taken from him, he fumed and stormed at the ill-luck that had robbed
him.</p>

<p>One day he returned to the house after a hard day's riding, and the
sight of its grime and disorder set a spark to his already smoldering
rage. His thoughts turned, as always at such moments, to the girl whose
place he honestly believed was there in his house where he had intended
to install her. She had been gone long enough. He had put up with
enough of her damned nonsense now, and it was time to round her up. He
regarded Nettie as a stray head of stock, that had slipped from under
the lariat noose, and was wandering in strange pastures. True, she was
a prized head, but that only strengthened the Bull's determination to
capture her. He considered her his personal stuff; something he had
branded, and he was not the man to part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> with anything that belonged to
him, as doggedly and repeatedly he assured himself she did, having been
bought with the rest of her dad's old truck.</p>

<p>Batt Leeson riding in from Barstairs brought him the first news of the
girl that he had had since the night she had fled in terror from his
house.</p>

<p>"Say, boss, who d'you suppose I seen when I rode by Yankee Valley?"</p>

<p>"How the h&mdash;&mdash; should I know?"</p>

<p>"Well, I seen that Day girl that used to work up here."</p>

<p>Bull Langdon, busy making of a bull-whip, twisting long strips of
cowhide about a lump of lead, stopped short in his work, and looked up
sharply at the slowly chewing, slowly talking ranch hand.</p>

<p>"What's that you say?"</p>

<p>"I was sayin' that I seen her&mdash;Nettie Day&mdash;over to Yankee Valley, and
where d'you suppose she's living? Say, she must be tied up now to that
Stanley fellow, because I seen her on his land and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a damned lie!" shouted the cattleman, and dashed the loaded
cowhide to the floor with a foul oath. Batt, his knees shaking with
terror, retreated before the advance of the enraged cowman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's true as God what I'm telling you. I seen her with my own eyes.
She was breakin' land on Stanley's quarter."</p>

<p>Bull Langdon's eyes were bloodshot and his face twitched hideously.</p>

<p>"That young scrub's at Bow Claire. His homestead's burned to the
ground. You can't come to me with no such tale as that."</p>

<p>"B&mdash;b-b-b&mdash;but I tell you she's workin' his land. I <i>seen</i> her. I
stopped right close and looked her over to make sure. I ain't makin' no
mistake. Thought at first I might be, cause I figure that a girl in her
condition wouldn't be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What-cha mean by her condition?"</p>

<p>"Sa-ay boss." Batt scratched his head, uncertain whether to proceed;
itching to tell the tale of the girl's fall, but fearing the menacing
spark in the cattleman's eyes. "I thought you knew."</p>

<p>"Knew what?"</p>

<p>"'Bout her condition."</p>

<p>Batt essayed a sly, ingratiating wink, but it had no placating effect
upon the man before him.</p>

<p>"I don't know what the devil you're talking about."</p>

<p>"Gosh, boss, everyone knows 'bout Nettie Day. <i>She's</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> agoin' to have a
baby&mdash;mebbe she's got it now. I expect she has."</p>

<p>"What-t!"</p>

<p>The Bull's eyes bulged; a tidal wave of unholy joy threatened to
overwhelm him.</p>

<p>A baby! His! His! His own! His and that gell's!</p>

<p>He threw back his head and burst into a storm of laughter. His wild
mirth shook the beams and rafters of the old room, and seemed to
reverberate all through the great house.</p>

<p>"Well, by G&mdash;&mdash;!" said the cowman and reached for his riding boots. He
pulled them savagely on, still chuckling and chortling, and pausing
ever and anon to smack his hip.</p>

<p>"Goin' riding, boss?"</p>

<p>"You betcher life I am."</p>

<p>"Where you goin'?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to a round up," said Bull Langdon, clicking his lips.</p>

<p>"After some loose stock?"</p>

<p>"A purebred heifer with a calf at heel," said Bull Langdon. "They've
got my brand upon them."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p>The Englishwoman stood in the doorway of her shack, rifle in hand, and
gazed calmly at the blustering cowman, who had dismounted, and, fists
on hips, was standing before her. For the first time in his life Bull
Langdon found himself face to face with a woman who was not afraid
of him. Her cold, unwavering glance traveled over him, from his flat
head down to his great, coarse feet, and back with cool disparagement
straight into his flinching eyes.</p>

<p>"You seen anything of that gell, Nettie Day?"</p>

<p>Angella disdained to answer. She was looking over his head, and
presently she said:</p>

<p>"Will you kindly remove yourself from my place? I don't want you here."</p>

<p>"You don't, heh? Well, I'm here to get something of my own, do you get
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I get you all right; but you'll take nothing off <i>my</i> place,
you may be sure of that."</p>

<p>He stood his ground with bravado, and blurted out his errand; he had
come for Nettie, and intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> have her and his kid. She belonged
to him; was his "gell," and he had bought her along with her "dad's
old truck." He'd have been over sooner, but his cattle had tied him
down since his return from the States, and he "wan't the kind o' man to
neglect his cattle for a woman."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Angella's level gaze rested coolly upon him, and met his
blustering outburst with a half-smile of detached and amused contempt.
But when he made a movement as if to enter the house, Angella Loring
slowly brought her rifle to her shoulder, and aimed straight at him.
With the practiced eye of a dead shot, she squinted down the length of
the barrel, and the Bull sprang back, when he saw her finger crooked
upon the trigger.</p>

<p>"What the h&mdash;&mdash; you tryin' to do?"</p>

<p>She answered without lowering the gun or moving her finger.</p>

<p>"You clear off my place! If you attempt to enter my house I'll shoot
you down with less compunction than I would a dog."</p>

<p>He slouched a few paces farther back, and an evil laugh broke from his
lips. Once he had reached his horse's side, his bravado returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guess there ain't goin' to be no trouble gettin' what's my own. The
law's on my side. I've got as much right to that kid, that's my own
stuff, as the gell has."</p>

<p>"Oh, have you?" said Angella coolly. "Unfortunately for you, the child
is no longer even Nettie's. It's mine. She gave me her child for
adoption."</p>

<p>"She hadn't no right to do that," said the Bull in a sudden access of
rage. "It ain't hers to give away."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it, though?"</p>

<p>"No, it ain't, and I'll show you a thing o' two. There won't be no
funny business with guns neither when a couple of mounties come up here
after what's mine."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't talk about the law if I were you. You see, when you
committed that crime against Nettie, she happened to be a minor. I
don't know just how many years in the penitentiary that may mean for
you. Her lawyers will know."</p>

<p>At the word "penitentiary," his face had turned gray. Nettie's youth
had never occurred to him before, nor what it might mean for him.</p>

<p>"Besides," went on the Englishwoman, "apart from the legal aspects
of the case, I wonder that you take a chance in a country like this.
Consider what is likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> to happen to you, if the truth about Nettie
becomes known in this ranching country. We have an unwritten law of
our own in such cases, you know, and everybody has been blaming an
innocent boy. What will they say&mdash;what will they do, when they know
that the most detested and hated man in the country attacked a young,
defenseless girl when she was alone in his house? I wouldn't care to
be in your shoes when <i>that</i> fact leaks out, as you may be sure it
will. I'll take care of that! You can trust me to denounce you without
reserve!"</p>

<p>The Bull shouted, purple with rage:</p>

<p>"There ain't no man livin' <i>I'm</i> afraid of, and there ain't no man in
the country strong enough to lay a finger on me, see. I could beat
every son of a gun in Alberta to a pulp."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that. You look as if you might have the strength of a
gorilla; but then where a hand will not serve a rope will, and you know
it will be short work for your own men to hang you to a tree when young
Cyril Stanley ropes you. Now I've talked to you enough. You get off my
place, or I'll put a shot in that ugly fist of yours that'll lame you
for the rest of your days."</p>

<p>He had remounted and she laughed at his haste; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> as he rode off, the
venomous expression on his face turned her heart cold with a new fear,
and her ears rang ominously with his parting words.</p>

<p>"So long, old hen, you'll sing another tune when we meet again."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p>"Jake, I want you to ride like 'hell on fire' to Springbank, where
you'll find Dr. McDermott. Ask at the post office for him, and you may
meet him on the trail. Don't spare Daisy, even if you have to kill her
riding. Leave her at Springbank to rest up, and come back with the
Doc. And Jake, if you get back by tomorrow night, I'll&mdash;I'll give you
a whole pound of brown sugar and a can of molasses. Now skedaddle, and
for God's sake, don't fail us."</p>

<p>"Me go! Me fly on the air!" cried the breed excitedly. Without saddle
or bridle&mdash;nothing but a halter rope, Jake was on the Indian broncho,
and was off like a flash over the trail.</p>

<p>Angella concealed her fears from the white and trembling Nettie.</p>

<p>"Nothing to worry about," she said carelessly. "He's afraid of my gun,
Nettie, the big coward!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Angel, I'm not afraid for myself, but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> baby. He's a
terrible man when he's in a passion, and he never gives up nothing
that's his."</p>

<p>"But you're not his," said Angel sharply, "and neither is the baby.
He's mine. You said I could have him, and I won't give him up."</p>

<p>"Oh, Angel, I don't want you to. He's better with you than anyone
else, and although I do love him&mdash;" Nettie's voice was breaking
piteously&mdash;"yet there are times when I <i>can't</i> forget that he's the
Bull's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's not. He's all yours, Nettie. There's not a trace of that wild
brute in our baby. I don't see how you can even think it. Just look
at the darling," and she held up the laughing, fair-haired baby at
arm's length. The days spent out of doors in the field had done much
to give him the health and strength that had not been his at birth. He
had Nettie's eyes and hair, but not her seriousness, for he crowed and
laughed all day long, the happiest and most contented baby in the world.</p>

<p>Nettie looked at him now with swimming eyes.</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> sweet!" she said in a choking voice, and kneeling beside
Angella, on whose lap the baby lay, she buried her head in his little
soft body.</p>

<p>Jake did not return the following night, nor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> night after. Though
each sought to hide her anxiety from the other, the two women kept
a constant look-out along the trail, straining their ears for the
comforting sound of the motor, which on a still day could sometimes be
heard at two or even three miles' distance.</p>

<p>They would have gone away somewhere, but for the fact that the
threshers were due in a few days' time, and it would have meant ruin to
leave the crop unthreshed. Once the threshing was done, and the grain
safely stored in the granary, or sold direct to the commission men who
had already called upon Angella, they would be free to make a trip to
Calgary, and there seek counsel and protection.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, every night they bolted and barricaded their door, and with
the baby between them, with loaded guns side by side on the bed, hardly
slept through the night. Wide-eyed and silent in the darkness they kept
their vigil, each hoping that the other slept.</p>

<p>On the third night, toward morning, Nettie started up with a cry. She
had heard something moving outside the shack. They gripped their rifles
and sat up listening intently. Then Angella declared that it was only
the wind, and Nettie said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"It sounds like thunder, doesn't it? Maybe we're goin' to have another
storm."</p>

<p>"Let it storm," said Angella, glad of the other's voice in the
darkness. "Our crop's harvested, and no hail can hurt us now. Is the
light still going in the kitchen?"</p>

<p>"Yes." After a moment, Nettie said:</p>

<p>"I ain't afraid of nothing now for myself, but I don't want nothing to
happen to you&mdash;and my baby."</p>

<p>"My baby you mean," corrected Angella, pretending to laugh. But with
all the tenderness of her maternal heart, she drew the baby close to
her side.</p>

<p>After another long tense pause, when they again imagined things
stirring about the place, Angella said suddenly:</p>

<p>"Let's talk. I can't sleep and neither can you, and we never do talk
much."</p>

<p>"I expect that's because we've always had to work most o' the time,"
said Nettie. "Isn't it queer that you and me should be such friends."</p>

<p>"Why queer?"</p>

<p>"I'm what they call 'scrub' stock&mdash;and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So'm I&mdash;scrub. That's the kind worth being. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> common clay, Nettie.
The other kind is shoddy and false and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Angel, I think you're so sweet and good."</p>

<p>"I'm not sweet and good," said Angella stoutly, "and there's nothing
heroic about me."</p>

<p>"I don't care what you are," said Nettie, "I'll always love you.
Sometimes when I get thinkin' of how hard everything's been for me in
this life, I think of you and Mrs. Langdon, and I say to myself: You're
a lucky girl, Nettie. Not everybody in the world has got a friend! Have
they, Angel?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;very few of us have," said Angella sadly. "Nettie, did you hear
that!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It sounded like&mdash;like a moan. Listen!"</p>

<p>In the dark silence of the night, the long-drawn moaning sound was
repeated.</p>

<p>"It's cattle," said Nettie.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know their calls, though I didn't know there was any near
us."</p>

<p>"Passing along the trail probably. It's getting toward the fall, you
know."</p>

<p>"Angel, do you believe in God?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;that is, yes&mdash;in a way I do. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mrs. Langdon used to say that God was in us&mdash;in our hearts. He
can't be in every heart, can he?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, Bull Langdon's for instance. God <i>couldn't</i> abide in <i>his</i>
heart, could he?"</p>

<p>"No, I should think not."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Langdon believed it. She used to say that God loved him as
well as any of us, but that Bull was 'in error,' and that some day God
would open his eyes, and then he would be powerful good."</p>

<p>"Hm! He'd have to open his eyes pretty wide, I'm thinking," said Angel.
"But try and sleep now, Nettie. I'm feeling a bit drowsy myself. Maybe
we can snatch a wink or two before morning. Good-night, Nettie."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Angel. I think it's true. God <i>is</i> in our hearts. I
believe it."</p>

<p>"I believe he's in yours, anyway," said Angella softly. "Good-night,
old girl."</p>

<p>But God dwelt not in the heart of Bull Langdon. Under the silver light
of the moon, that lay like a spell upon the sleeping land, and across
the shining valley, came the cowman, driving a great herd of steers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Penned in corrals for shipment to the Calgary stockyards, they had been
without food for two days, and now they came down the hill, eager and
impatient for the feed that had been too long denied them.</p>

<p>The Bull, on his huge bay mare, drove them rapidly before him whirling
and cracking his long whip over their heads. The Banff highway was
deserted. He chose the gritty roads, and, heads down, the hungry steers
nosed the bare ground, till they came to the level lands, and turned
into the road allowances between the farms. The grain fields, odorous
of cut hay and grain, inflamed the hunger-maddened steers, and they
moaned and sniffed as they were driven mercilessly along.</p>

<p>All day and most of the night they traveled without pause and in the
first gray of the dawn they arrived at the frail fences of the Lady
Angella Loring. Down went the two insecure lines of barbed wire that
the women had set up, never counting they would be needed to withstand
the impetuous stampede of wild cattle.</p>

<p>When Angella and Nettie stepped out of their shack later that morning
their shocked eyes were greeted with Bull Langdon's vindictive work.
The road was still gray with the raised dust of the departing animals
turning off the road allowance for the main trail, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> Bar Q brand
showing clearly on their left ribs. Filled to the neck with the reaped
grain, they were rolling heavily along the way into Calgary.</p>

<p>The two girls stood before their barren fields, overwhelmed by the
magnitude of the disaster that had befallen them. Not a word was said,
but Angella, as if grown suddenly old, turned blindly to the house,
while Nettie threw herself down desperately upon the ground and burst
into bitter tears.</p>

<p>Her little work-roughened hands fallen loosely by her side, Angella
sat at the crude wooden table of her own making, and tried to figure
a way out of the appalling problem now facing her. She had bought her
implements on the installment plan, and the money was now due; she owed
the municipality for her seed; a chattel mortgage was on her stock.
That year's crop would have wiped out all her indebtedness, and left
her free and clear.</p>

<p>When her crops had failed before, she had made up her losses by
working at the Bar Q, and the small proceeds of the sale of eggs and
butter; but now she had not only herself to consider. There were two
other living creatures entirely dependent upon her. To the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> desolate,
heart-starved woman, Nettie and her baby had become nearer and dearer
to her than her own kin.</p>

<p>Nettie, still lying on the bitten down stubble, was roused from her
stupor of grief by a pulling at her sleeve, and looking up, she saw
the half-breed Jake. He was kneeling beside her, holding out a little
bunch of buttercups, and in the poor fellow's face she read his grief
and anxiety. Nettie tried to smile through her tears, and she took the
flowers gratefully.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jake. Where'd you come from?" she asked, wiping her eyes,
though her breath still came in gasping sobs, and she could not hide
her tears.</p>

<p>"Jake come out like 'Hell on fire' in Doctor's nortermobile. Beeg,
beeg ride&mdash;run like wind&mdash;run like hell on road. Doc"&mdash;he jerked his
thumb back&mdash;"go into house. He eat foods. Jake got a hongry inside too.
<i>She</i> tell Jake she give'm molasses and sugar." He smacked his lips
at thought of his favorite food, but the next moment he was studying
Nettie's wet face in troubled bewilderment.</p>

<p>"What's matter, Nettie? <i>Him</i> hurt Nettie yes again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Jake, again." Her lip quivered.</p>

<p>The half-breed's face flamed savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Bull! He no good! Jake kill 'im some day sure."</p>

<p>He waved his arms wildly, and Nettie shook her head, smiling at him
sadly.</p>

<p>"Keep away from him, Jake. He's powerful strong, and there wouldn't be
nothing much left of you if he once got his hands on you."</p>

<p>"Jake not afraid of the Bull," said the half-breed, shaking his head.
"Listen, Nettie. Me&mdash;Jake Langdon&mdash;me take a peech fork, beeg long
likea this, and me jab him in the eye of the Bull, yes? That's kill
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Jake. He'd get it from you. He'd rastle it out of your hands."</p>

<p>"Then me&mdash;Jake steal on house when he's sleep. Get a long big
nail&mdash;like this big&mdash;hammer him into ear. That same way many Indian do."</p>

<p>"Keep away from him, Jake. You'll only get the worst of it."</p>

<p>"Jake don't mind worst. That's nothing. Jake no like see cry on Nettie."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll not cry any more. You pick me some more buttercups,
Jake, and&mdash;and don't you worry about me. <i>I'm</i> all right."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Inside the shack, Dr. McDermott had broken his habitual Scotch
reticence and blazed into fluent fury. He had met the Bar Q herd along
the road, and had suspected something wrong. As he drove by Angella's
fields he realized what had happened, and her first words confirmed his
suspicions.</p>

<p>"Bull Langdon turned his steers into my crop. He has ruined us."</p>

<p>"The hound! The dirty, cowardly hound! I'll have him jailed for this."</p>

<p>"You can't, doctor," said Angella wearily, "we didn't have the legal
fence&mdash;just two wires. You warned us. I wish I had taken your advice."</p>

<p>"Then I'll beat him to a pulp, with my own hands!" said the enraged
doctor.</p>

<p>Angella looked up at him with a pitying smile.</p>

<p>"No, man you shan't do that. I wouldn't have you soil your hands
touching him."</p>

<p>Her head dropped, and for a long time no word was spoken in the little
shack. Dr. McDermott, tongue-tied, stared down at the bowed head of
Angella. Presently she said, without looking up, but in a sort of
hopeless, dead way:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dr. McDermott, I'm through. I can't go on fighting. I'm beat."</p>

<p>"Through!" roared her friend, who had once preached so violently
against her laboring as a man, "lass, you've only begun! You're of a
fighting race&mdash;a grand race, and you'll go down fighting. You're not of
the breed to admit you're beat."</p>

<p>"Little you know of my breed," she said sadly.</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott took the chair opposite her, thrust out his chin and
forced her to look at him.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the stable lad ye whipped because he'd not let you
ride the young Spitfire?" he said. "Don't you remember the lad that
twenty-five years ago your father sent away to college in Glasgow?"</p>

<p>Her eyes grew wide and bright as she stared at him as though she saw
him for the first time. Color touched her cheeks, she looked like a
girl again. For a moment she could not speak, but only stare at him.
Out of the mists of memory she was seeing again the barefooted boy she
had stolen away many a time to play with; it was incredible that he and
this rugged Scotch doctor, who had forced his friendship upon her out
in the wilds of Canada, should be one and the same.</p>

<p>"Are you really that boy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, with a catch in her voice:</p>

<p>"Why, I must have been blind." A little sob of delight at this
miraculous encounter rose in her throat.</p>

<p>"Then you are&mdash;Angus. That was your name, wasn't it. Oh, I <i>have</i> been
blind!"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five years is a long time, my lady."</p>

<p>"Don't call me, my lady. I hate it."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that, ma'am," said the doctor solemnly, which made her
laugh.</p>

<p>"And now," he pleaded, roughly, though in desperate earnest, "you'll
be taking back the money that your father spent to make a doctor of a
stable lad, will you not? You'll let me stake you, lass?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you've more than paid that debt. This ranch alone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a homestead&mdash;a free gift of the Canadian Government. It'll not
begin to pay for the cost of a mon's education. A debt's a debt, and I
trust you'll allow a mon to wipe out a heavy obligation."</p>

<p>At that Angella smiled, but her eyes were wet.</p>

<p>"If you put it that way, Dr. McDermott, of course, there's nothing else
for me to do but let you&mdash;let you&mdash;stake me&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"I will!" said the man, scowling at her angrily, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> he cleared his
throat, and asked for a "bite of food for a hungry mon who's been
working day and night to hammer a bit of common sense into a bunch of
farmers whose heads are made of wood."</p>

<p>Angella even laughed as she bustled about the kitchen, preparing a
quick meal for the doctor, and when she set it before him she asked:</p>

<p>"Who's sick now, doctor?"</p>

<p>"The whole country's nigh down," he muttered. "If they don't heed the
warning I've been trying to hammer into their systems for months now,
there'll be a sad lot of sick and dead folk before the winter's out, I
tell you."</p>

<p>"As bad as all that?"</p>

<p>He replied solemnly:</p>

<p>"Couldn't be worse. Mark my words, if the plague comes up to the
country from Calgary, where it's got a foothold already, our population
will be cut in half."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p>Like a thief in the night the plague crept into Alberta, disguised at
first in the form of light colds to which the sufferers paid small
attention, but before the year was out those neglected colds had turned
into the scourge whose virulence singled out the strong, the fair and
the young for its victims.</p>

<p>Calgary was like a beleaguered city at bay against the attack of a
dread enemy. The printed warnings everywhere in the newspapers and
placarded in public places and street cars; the newspaper accounts of
the progress of the sickness in Europe, the United States and eastern
Canada, with the long list of deaths threw the healthy city of the
foothills into a state of panic.</p>

<p>Schools were closed; the people were afraid to go to church;
disinfectant was sprayed over every store and office. The faintest
symptom of a cold, the least sneeze was diagnosed as plague, and
the growing fear in which the people awaited the disaster created a
hysterical condition that probably precipitated its coming. Slowly and
surely, undeterred by precaution and prayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> alike, the terrible plague
was drawing in upon Alberta.</p>

<p>The first definitely diagnosed cases came in early summer, when the
weather is raw and cold as it always is there. At that early season
only two or three cases were discovered, but all the members of medical
and nursing professions volunteered or were conscripted for service. By
a curious negligence, no means of protection were taken for the vast
country that surrounded the City of the Foothills on every side, and it
was even said that many cases that the authorities failed to report had
been sent off "to the country."</p>

<p>If the city authorities were indifferent to the fate of the country
regions, on which, by the way Calgary was wholly dependent, there was
one man at least who kept the welfare of his beloved country close to
his heart. The erstwhile Scotch stable lad, who for many years had
dedicated his thought, his labor and his heart to the farming and
ranching people of Alberta, begrudged himself even a few hours sleep.
Night and day, he "kept the road," keeping the keenest watch for the
first outbreak of the epidemic, well knowing that plague respected
neither person nor place, but leaped across the great cities even to
the remotest places of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>The warm summer brought an abatement of the menace, but when the first
frost came in with the fall, the plague fell like a cloudburst upon the
country.</p>

<p>Calgary, the city of sunlight and optimism, became a place of suffering
and death. Scarcely a house but the dreaded visitor entered to take
his tragic and inexplicable toll of the youngest and strongest there.
People went about half-dazed, as if they were living in a nightmare.
Hospitals, schools, churches, theaters, every available public building
was turned into a house of refuge. No one was allowed on the street
without a mask of white gauze fastened over nose and mouth.</p>

<p>The terrible crisis brought to light the extreme scarcity of nurses
and doctors. Although an army of volunteer nurses were recruited by
the city authorities, they were inadequate to the needs of all those
stricken households, where one after another died for sheer lack of
care and attention. The hospitals and all the emergency stations were
filled to overflowing.</p>

<p>In spite of the almost superhuman expenditure of effort, the death
lists grew from day to day. Crpe hung from every second door in the
city, and every day a ghastly procession of hearses, automobiles, and
every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> vehicle that moved on wheels, passed through the streets laden
with Calgary's dead.</p>

<p>All the surrounding towns had succumbed meanwhile, and the smaller the
towns, the heavier was the mortality for lack of skilled doctors and
nurses and fit accommodation for the patients.</p>

<p>Most desperate of all, however, was the plight of those who lived on
farms and ranches and at camps beyond the reach of help. The state of
things in the Indian Reserves was appalling. The Indians were dying
like flies, their misery forgotten by their white protectors. In their
ignorance and helplessness, they sought help at the farms and ranches,
only to be turned away, and often they carried the plague into places
which had been immune until then.</p>

<p>Half the countryside was down with the disease, and still Dr. McDermott
was vainly applying to the city and provincial authorities for help.
Seeing that his demands were falling on deaf ears, he tried to impress
into service men and women ranchers whose families had not yet been
attacked, trying to make them understand that at such a time it was
everybody's duty to do what he could. But the fear that had paralyzed
the cities had now reached the farmers, and the doctor's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> appeal
brought little response. In their desire to escape, many families shut
themselves up in their homes, discharged their help and hung signs
on their gates: "Keep away!" They closed their doors in the faces of
friends and strangers both, and only opened them when they in their
turn were forced to cry for help. A few did respond, it is true, to the
doctor's call for help, but nearly always were themselves overtaken
before they had served very long, and the demand for help of any kind
was so overwhelming that it was well-nigh impossible to do more than
show the sick how to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>Overworked and exhausted, worn out with lack of sleep, Dr. McDermott
stopped one day at Angella Loring's ranch.</p>

<p>The two girls were coming in from the field, Angella in the democrat
with the baby, and Nettie on foot, driving home a team of work horses.
They had been plowing and repairing the broken fences, for undaunted by
the destruction of their crop, they were pluckily on the land again,
preparing for the next year's seeding.</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott, his bag on the step by him, watched them as they watered
and fed their horses and put up for the night. Then, each taking a
handle of the baby's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> basket, they came through the barnyard to the
house.</p>

<p>For the first time since she had known her doctor friend, he failed to
greet Nettie with his cheery:</p>

<p>"And how's my lass today?"</p>

<p>Gaunt and haggard, he stood up and scrutinized them gravely before
grunting:</p>

<p>"Hm! All right, eh? Not touched. Well, sit down, girls. I've thot to
tell you will make your hearts a wee bit heavy."</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott opened his black bag and took out some pills and a large
bottle of disinfectant, which he set on the steps. Angella, the baby in
her arms, her brows slightly drawn, looked down at the lined face of
the doctor, and saw he had brought bad news.</p>

<p>"Let's go in," she said. "You look as if a cup of tea won't come amiss.
Let me pass. I'll make it at once."</p>

<p>"You'll hear me through first, and I've no time for tea. There's a bit
of sickness running about the country. 'Tis the same they've had in the
old land. You'll put this disinfectant about your place, and on your
person, and in case&mdash;in case of certain symptoms, you'll go straight to
bed, and you'll stay there till I tell you when to get up, and you'll
begin then to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> the pills I'm leaving. What's more, you'll send
Jake at once for me."</p>

<p>There was a pause, as Nettie's eyes met Angella's.</p>

<p>"Needn't worry about me, doc," said Nettie. "I'm awfully healthy. You
don't have to give me no pills."</p>

<p>The doctor glared at her furiously.</p>

<p>"That's the ignorant sort of talk I've been listening to all summer;
but the very ones who boasted of their strength are the ones stricken."</p>

<p>"What are the symptoms?" interposed Angella.</p>

<p>"Symptoms? Fever, backache, headache, nose bleed, a tendency to sneeze,
hot and cold flashes."</p>

<p>Angella's face paled, and her glance went furtively from Nettie to the
baby.</p>

<p>"Are there many down?" she questioned with assumed casualness.</p>

<p>"Thousands, ma'am, in the city, and God knows how many in the country."</p>

<p>"What are they doing for help?"</p>

<p>"In the country they are doing without it&mdash;shifting for themselves."</p>

<p>Angella looked startled, and Nettie turned round, her slow gaze fixed
upon the doctor's face.</p>

<p>"Who's taking care of them, then?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're takin' care of themselves. They creep out of bed and crawl to
each other, and some of 'em die before they can get back to their own
beds. In most of the families that have it, they are all down at once."</p>

<p>"Now, look here," said Angella abruptly, "you've got to have some
supper before you start off."</p>

<p>"No time for supper. There's nine in the Homan family down, including
the help. I'm on my way now."</p>

<p>He had snapped his bag closed. Nettie passed by him into the house.
Angella paused at the door and caught him by the sleeve to detain him.</p>

<p>"Really, doctor, it won't do you a bit of good to try and take care of
people if you don't take care of yourself first; you've got to eat. So
you come right in. It won't take me a minute to fix something for you."</p>

<p>"No, can't stop. I had a bite at noon, and will reach Homan's in time
for another sup."</p>

<p>"Well, wait. A minute or two more or less won't matter. I want to know
about this. Can't you get nurses from Calgary, and aren't there any
other doctors in the country?"</p>

<p>"There are three besides myself over my territory, but two of 'em's
down, and the other&mdash;" The doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> scowled and muttered something about
"white-livered coward."</p>

<p>"And nurses?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I've been unable to get <i>anyone</i>. The city nurses have
their hands full in town, and they won't come up to the country. As for
the women themselves&mdash;the farm women, those who are not down, have gone
plumb crazy with fright. I've gone from ranch to ranch like a beggar,
imploring help."</p>

<p>Nettie had come out again. She had changed from her overalls to the
blue house dress that Mrs. Langdon had made for her and over this she
had thrown a plaid shawl. The blue woolen tam that Angella had knitted
for her was on her head, and she looked singularly young and sweet. A
few articles of clothing were knotted in a neat bundle under her arm.</p>

<p>"Doc," she said, "I'm going with you."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Dr. McDermott blinked up at her, scowled,
grunted something under his breath, and cleared his throat loudly.
Angella stood stiffly by the door, not attempting to move, and her arm
tightened involuntarily about the baby.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully strong," went on Nettie, "and I ain't likely to ketch
nothing, and it don't matter if I do, far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> as that goes. It's up to me
to help those that need me. You'll let me go, won't you, doc?"</p>

<p>"You're a good lass," muttered the doctor, "and you'll be a grand help
to me."</p>

<p>At last Angella found her voice.</p>

<p>"Nettie, you're forgetting your&mdash;baby!" she said.</p>

<p>Nettie turned sharply round and the bundle fell from her hand.</p>

<p>"No, no, Angel, I've not forgotten him; but you'll be good to him,
won't you? and he'll never miss me."</p>

<p>"Nettie Day, don't dare talk like that," said Angella savagely. "I
won't let you go if you have any thought like that in your head."</p>

<p>But Nettie did not hear her. For the first time since her baby's birth
she was holding it in her arms, and the feel of the little warm face
against her own brought a pang to her heart that was both agony and
joy. Motherhood seemed to have come to her in a sudden rush of feeling,
and her face was as white as death when she at last gave her child back
solemnly to Angel. The movement awakened the baby, and now its cry was
more than she could bear. She clasped her hands over her ears, and
rushed to the gate. Dr. McDermott picked up her bundle and followed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p>Of the thirty or forty men previously employed at the Bar Q, only two
remained that winter&mdash;a Chinaman and Batt Leeson at the Bull Camp. The
foothill ranch was completely deserted, and the Bull was left alone to
look after his several thousand head of cattle.</p>

<p>When the plague reached the country regions, there was a general exodus
from the ranches, for tales were rife of stricken men corralled like
cattle in bunkhouses and barns and left to shift for themselves.</p>

<p>That winter the cattle in the foothills roamed the range like
mavericks, rustling for their water and feed. But even then they were
better off than the purebred stock at Barstairs, being hardy stuff
bred to the range and the open fields, where they found ample feed.
The pampered purebred cattle had always been used to care and nursing,
having been practically raised by hand, and were accustomed to feed
from troughs heaped up with food by the watchful attendants and hands.
Now penned in narrow pastures and cattle sheds, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> the ground was
bare as stone, they were irregularly left to the tender mercies of the
half-dazed and always drunken Batt Leeson, and spasmodically fed and
seldom watered.</p>

<p>Chum Lee, paralyzed with fear of the "black plague," which had cut
down all of his "boys" at the Bull Camp, lived in terror that it
would overtake him also. Chum Lee had no desire to die in the white
man's land; he wanted to repose in peace under the sacred soil of
his ancestors. He would have run away from the camp, but the barren
country, with its vast blanket of snow, gave no hope of any refuge, and
he feared Bull Langdon as though he were an evil spirit.</p>

<p>Back and forth between the two ranches the Bull's great car tore like a
Juggernaut of Fate. It did not in the least concern the cattleman that
his men had died like flies, or that three&mdash;quarters of the country was
down with the plague. What alarmed and incensed him was the fact that
his cattle, the magnificent herd that he had built up from the three or
four head rustled from the Indians, were roaming the range uncared-for
and neglected. Many of them, drifting before a bitter blizzard, had
perished in coulee and canyon, and worse still was the deterioration of
the purebreds. The loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> of a single head of this stock meant several
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Nor was the Bull exclusively occupied with the loss of his cattle; he
brooded unceasingly over Nettie Day, though the vision of her refused
to leave his tortured mind and at the thought of the child she had
borne he would rage up and down like a caged beast. The child had
made her more than ever his, he gloated; yet how should he ever gain
possession of her? He knew that the "Loring woman's" words had not been
idle, and in imagination he saw the black walls of the penitentiary
looming in the future. Nevertheless, he intended to have her; though
the whole world might stand against him, he would get her back. He
would bide his time, and his day would come&mdash;&mdash; The Loring woman would
not always be on guard. His day would come.</p>

<p>Nettie was nursing the stricken farmers; the pariah and despised of
the foothills was going from ranch to ranch caring for those who had
condemned her. She had sat up for many nights soothing and ministering
to their suffering; she had closed the eyes of their best beloved, and
her tears had dropped upon the faces of their dead. In their hours of
deepest anguish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> agony, they had clung to her cool, strong hands,
as to an anchor.</p>

<p>The country people had reversed their opinion and judgment of Nettie
Day; her past was forgotten; she was their Nettie now.</p>

<p>By the end of January the plague had reached its peak. Whole families
had persisted and others were slowly creeping back to health and hope
again. It would not be long, Dr. McDermott promised Nettie, before she
would be free to return to her baby and her friend.</p>

<p>She began to count the days, and to scan the skies for that shadowy
arch across the heavens that in Alberta precedes a "Chinook" and is the
forerunner of mild weather, for Dr. McDermott was expected to come for
her with the first Chinook. Nettie thought with ceaseless yearning of
her baby; away from him, he had taken visible shape in her mind, and,
at last able to overlook the horror of his paternity, she loved him
with all the passion of her young warm heart. When the Chinook at last
broke up the fierce cold Dr. McDermott kept his word, and on the day he
was to come for her, Nettie walked on air. She was going home&mdash;to her
baby!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>When the doctor arrived, however, his face was grave, and his heart lay
heavy within him. His labors were far from done. The Bow Claire Lumber
Camp had succumbed to the plague, and nearly a hundred men were down.</p>

<p>Calgary had promised help, but its former promises had not proved
reliable, and in all that vast country few would be found willing to go
deep into the heart of the timber lands to nurse the lumber-jacks.</p>

<p>The doctor's Ford chugged to the back door of the Munson farmhouse,
where Nettie had been nursing the last of her patients. She was there
to meet him, her old plaid cape about her and the woolen tam upon her
head. Her face was aglow, and her eyes shone as bright as stars; he had
telephoned her to expect him by noon, and had told her to be ready and
not keep him waiting.</p>

<p>Nettie had kissed the surviving three little Munsons and their mother,
suddenly filled with passionate remorse for her past cruelty to the
girl who had now saved their lives. She had shaken hands with the husky
voiced father, who had simply and reverently begged God's blessing for
her, and to hide her own tears, she had run from them and shut the
door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> between them. Now she was in the Ford, with the robes tucked
comfortably about her; breathlessly she squeezed the arm of her old
friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, doc, just to think, I'm goin' home now&mdash;home to Angel and my baby!
Oh, it's just heaven to be here beside you and on our way."</p>

<p>The "doc" had one of the new self-starters and there was no need of
cranking this year. They buzzed down the road in the "tin Lizzie,"
making a great racket and leaving in their wake a malodorous cloud of
smoke. For some time they went along in silence, and gradually Nettie's
happy mood fell from her as she noted the gravity of the doctor's face.
She touched his arm timidly, though her heart began to misgive her.</p>

<p>"Can you really spare me now, doc?"</p>

<p>There was no answer from her old friend, and Nettie pressed his arm,
repeating her question.</p>

<p>"Can you, doc?" And then, as still he did not answer: "Is any one else
down now?"</p>

<p>"Nettie." Dr. McDermott had slowed up. He tried to hide the anxiety in
his face, for he did not intend to ask any further sacrifice of the
girl, but he wanted <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>her to know the facts. "Nettie, the Bow Claire
Lumber Camp is down."</p>

<p>"The Bow Claire!"</p>

<p>The color receded from her face, her hand went to her heart as her
thoughts flew instantly to Cyril. Slowly she realized the meaning of
the doctor's solemn words.</p>

<p>"Nearly a hundred men, Nettie, and not a soul to care for them."</p>

<p>There was a long pause, while Dr. McDermott looked steadily ahead. The
car was pounding and sending out jets of steam from its lately frozen
radiator.</p>

<p>"Doc," cried the girl suddenly, "this ain't the road to Bow Claire.
Turn your car around!"</p>

<p>"A promise is a promise," said the doctor. "I promised I'd bring you
home to your child, lass, and I'll keep my word if you say so."</p>

<p>"But I don't say so. I don't want to go home&mdash;yet. I shouldn't be
happy&mdash;even with my baby. My place is where I am needed most, and you
should know where that is, doc."</p>

<p>"Dear lass," said the doctor gently. "They're needing you sore at Bow
Claire."</p>

<p>"Then turn your car around, doc, and don't you m-mind if I seem to
be c-cryin'. It's just because&mdash;because <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>I'm excited, and oh! I'm so
g-glad of the chance&mdash;of the opportunity, doc, to go 'long with you to
Bow Claire."</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott blinked through his misty glasses. He swung his wheel
sharply around, backed along the slippery, thawing ground, and went
over a culvert into a snow bank on the side of the road.</p>

<p>There was a grinding cough of the engine, and it stopped dead. Again
and again Dr. McDermott started the car, and back and forth it chugged
in a vain effort to pull out of the slippery snow pit. From under a
pile of produce and baggage, the doctor produced a snow shovel and
began the process of "digging out," making a road before and behind
where the car might back and get a fair start onto the road again. As
he shoveled the snow, digging under the car and all around it, they
heard the honk of an approaching motorist and gradually Bull Langdon's
huge touring car swung into sight. At the sound of the automobile horn,
Dr. McDermott had straightened up, intending to ask for aid, but when
he saw who it was he doggedly resumed his digging alone.</p>

<p>Bull Langdon took in the situation at a glance, and the sight of Nettie
cooled the fever that had possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> him for days. She was visibly
terrified at seeing him, and shrank back inside the Ford. The Bull
observed her agitation with fierce delight and all the old feeling of
domination over her came back to him. He got down from his car and
examined the spot where the back wheel seemed to have wedged itself in.</p>

<p>"Stuck, are you?" he gloated.</p>

<p>"We'll be out in a minute."</p>

<p>"Not on your life you won't. You'll not pull out of that today."</p>

<p>"Very well, if that's what you think, suppose you haul us out."</p>

<p>"Ain't got a rope, and my engine won't stand the gaff."</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott's wrathful stare met the Bull's insolent smile. He turned
his back upon him, and applied himself with savage energy to his work.</p>

<p>"Where you headed for?"</p>

<p>"None of your damned business."</p>

<p>"It ain't, heh?"</p>

<p>The Bull was now in high good humor. His hand rested upon the Ford,
close to where Nettie was crouching behind the curtain. His bold eyes
held hers fascinated with terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell you what I'll do," he suggested after a moment's pause, "I'll
take you aboard my car and pack you wherever you're goin'. You can
'phone the garage at Cochrane to send out and haul in your Lizzie."</p>

<p>Dr. McDermott could not see Nettie, but he could feel the silent,
desperate appeal which her fear of the Bull prevented her crying aloud.</p>

<p>"No," he felt her imploring him. "No&mdash;never! I would rather stay here
forever than go with him."</p>

<p>He looked the cattleman up and down with the same stare of cold
contempt and reprobation as that which had caused Bull Langdon to quail
before Angella Luring.</p>

<p>"We'll pull out without your help," said Dr. McDermott curtly. "Don't
need you. Don't want you."</p>

<p>"Hmph!" chuckled the Bull. He cut a chunk of chewing tobacco, and bit
calmly into it. He spat, and blinked his eyes at Nettie, then buttoning
up his big beaver fur coat, he moved towards his car. Climbing aboard,
he grinned down at the girl as he pushed the self-starter with his
foot. The engine instantly responded with its soft purring and the
great car glided along the road. A madness raged through the Bull as
he drove; his pent-up passion of months was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>finding an outlet at
last. The faster the car flew, the greater was his sense of relief and
elation, as he told himself he would find the car still stalled in the
same spot at nightfall when he returned for the girl.</p>

<p>As soon as the Bull's car had disappeared from sight Nettie was out of
the Ford.</p>

<p>"Oh, doc, he'll be back. I know he will."</p>

<p>"Let him. Nothin' to be afraid of. Feel in the pocket of the can&mdash;no,
the other one. Give me that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nettie passed the revolver to him, and the doctor thrust it into his
hip pocket.</p>

<p>"Now, lass, can you give me a hand?"</p>

<p>Together they pushed with might and main upon the car; it went up a few
paces, and slid back into the snow. Again they pushed, and this time,
at the doctor's order, Nettie found and thrust under the wheel a stone
that held it in place. The doctor then climbed aboard, and with Nettie
pushing behind, the Ford snorted forward a few feet, slipped back,
but jerked ahead again. There was a tremendous grinding noise, and
the whirling wheel went over the side of the culvert; the car jumped
forward. With a whoop of triumph, Dr. McDermott made room for Nettie
and they were off again. With loud clanking the flivver flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> along
those crazy roads, panted up incredibly steep and slippery grades,
plunged into snow fields and on into the timber land, where only the
narrow cattle trails made a path through the woods to the lumber camp.
They "made the grade" in two and a half hours of hard riding, and
pulled into the dead-still camp with a cheering honking of their horn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p>The meeting with Nettie on the road doubled the Bull's determination
to possess her again The exhilaration of the chance encounter and the
frustration of his plans when, returning, he found the little car
gone, had roused his desire to a pitch of insanity. Everything else
was forgotten; his cattle, his ranches, his great money losses, the
impossibility of obtaining help, even the deterioration of his prized
bulls at Barstairs&mdash;all these cares and anxieties ceased to exist in
the overpowering passion that consumed him.</p>

<p>Bull Langdon was incapable of love in its finer sense, but in his blind
and brutal way, he was madly in love with Nettie Day. His passion for
the girl was like a fire that burned and raged within him, seeking an
outlet where there was none and for the time being the man was like a
maniac.</p>

<p>He thought of the girl ceaselessly, chortling with delight as he
pictured her beauty, now sweeter than ever before in its young
maturity. He had not noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> a new quality of spirituality that
suffering had added to her loveliness, a certain light that seemed to
radiate from her; all he had seen was that the summer's work in the
fields had reddened her cheeks and brightened her eyes, and that her
lips were like a scarlet flame.</p>

<p>If he pictured Nettie as she had looked at him from her seat in the
doctor's Ford with her wide frightened eyes, his mind went back also
to those other days, when he had held the girl in his arms. Many a
night as he tramped the floor of the empty ranch house, his half-crazed
mind lived over and over the joy of those days when he had held her
in his power&mdash;"like purebred stuff in the Squeezegate." She had been
weak and docile then, a timid, terrified captive; but now there was a
new expression in her face, a look that was like a shield&mdash;a warning
guard that held him back and warned him that if trapped again she
would struggle to the death. He told himself he had no desire to hurt
her&mdash;he wanted only to have her back, where he believed she belonged by
right; he would make her the second Mrs. Langdon. And at the thought of
Nettie, at the Bar Q, reigning in the great ranch house, keeping the
place clean and sweet as his first wife had done, the Bull threw out
his arms and clinched them to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> as if in fact the struggling girl
were actually in their grasp, and he crooned words of savage tenderness
to his vision, only to moan and whimper the next moment as he came back
to reality again.</p>

<p>His desperation made him resourceful and cunning. He looked for Nettie
Day at every farm and ranch in the foothills and in the adjoining
prairie country. His car no longer tore along the roads from Bar Q to
Barstairs, as he superintended the care of his demoralized herd. He had
started now upon another hunt, and was running to earth a quarry whose
price he set above all else.</p>

<p>His spying at the Loring ranch had revealed the fact that Nettie was
not there, but, laying in wait for the unfortunate Jake, his son of an
earlier passion, in due time he captured and tortured the half-breed.
He had picked him up on the trail, racing bare-back upon some errand
into the hills, and his questions as to the whereabouts of Nettie,
accompanied by prods and kicks, had brought the stuttered information
that she was "far way off on the hills. She at lumber camp. Everybody
gone die on Bow Claire."</p>

<p>That was enough for the Bull. He knew now where the girl was, but the
knowledge, instead of satisfying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> and calming him, did the very reverse
when he realized that Nettie and Cyril were once more together. That
thought obsessed him, and filled his mind with murderous designs.</p>

<p>In the midst of his fury he reminded himself of Nettie's baby and a new
idea, charged with possibilities, occurred to him. If he could not take
the girl by force, there was one way by which she could be lured to Bar
Q. He was amazed that he had not thought of it before. Human nature, he
knew, was no different from cattle nature, where the young ones were
concerned. The cattle mother would go, if necessary, through walls
of fire and stone to reach her offspring, and what would keep Nettie
Day from going to Bar Q, if she knew her baby was there? It was never
necessary to throw the lariat upon the mother's neck; the roping of her
child was always enough. Bull Langdon swung his car around.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p>Two "green" hands were now at Bar Q. They had been sent out by the
Government Employment office, and for several days before his search
for Nettie had begun Bull Langdon had been trying to break them into
the cattle "game." They were English, guileless, clean-cut youngsters
of good family, who looked upon the foully swearing cowman as a
pathological subject that both interested and amazed them.</p>

<p>Their knowledge of ranching or "rawnching," as they called it, was of
the vaguest, but they were good riders and the life appealed to them as
sportsmen.</p>

<p>One of the anomalies of the ranching population of Alberta is its
tremendous variety of types. Here you will find a man who can neither
read nor write, and his neighbor, often his chum, will be the son
of an English lord, one of those odd derelicts that drift over from
the Old Country and take so kindly to the ranch life that more often
than not they return unwillingly to their homes. University men and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>agriculturists experimenting with irrigation projects and intensive
cultivation live side by side with business men and men from New York
and other great cities in the States, who for diverse reasons have
broken away from the cities, and gone in for farming on a big scale,
raising the business of farming to the level of great enterprises
rather than the slovenly and weary process it usually is. For the
most part, however, the farming population of Alberta is made up of
that solid, plodding type that have trekked out from eastern Canada
or the midwestern states, tempted by the cheapness of the land and
the richness of the soil. These are the backbone of the country and
between these and the others are sandwiched colonies of peasants from
Scandinavia and other parts of Europe.</p>

<p>It is with the hired man as with the owner. He may be an illiterate
clod of the old type, or a fresh-faced college-bred son of a man of
wealth, even of title, or again some chance wanderer, gone "broke" in
the colony, and using up the remittance from home on drink and cards.
Besides these there is also the type of English student and sportsman,
who enjoys "roughing it" and hires out partly for experience and partly
for a lark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>To this latter type the men at Bar Q belonged. They had come up largely
to escape a city of gloom and plague, and were extremely anxious to
remain at the great ranch. The Bull, intent on getting away, endeavored
in a few days to teach them what he called the "A B C" of ranching.
They demonstrated their ability to remain in the saddle eight or ten
hours at a stretch, and to ride over thirty or forty miles without
undue fatigue.</p>

<p>The Bull showed them "the ropes"; pointed out where certain cattle were
to be gathered in; indicated the fields where they were to be driven,
and promising to return "in a few days," as he rode off and left the
"tenderfeet" in charge of the great ranch.</p>

<p>After his departure, the two young Englishmen rode over the place,
marked the likely places for big game, took a "pot" or two at the
yowling coyote on a hill; rode over the pleasant hills and pasture
land, back to the comfortable bunkhouse, and decided that they had a
"snap" and that "rawnching" was the life for them. It was a jolly sight
better than hanging around a small city up to its neck in sickness. In
the warm spell that followed soon after the departure of Bull Langdon,
the Englishmen "rode the range" like <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>hunters, and their methods of
rounding up cattle, though weird, were highly effective. They raced
and chased the cattle, galloping along at top speed, thrilled by the
spectacle of the fleeing herd which they persistently and doggedly
tried to overtake. The experienced cowpuncher lopes along leisurely
behind or alongside a bunch of cattle, taking care not to hurry them,
for to run cattle is to "knock the beef" off them. That spring the lean
cattle of the Bar Q amazed even the least sophisticated ranch folk, and
it is certain that the guileless Englishmen never dreamed they were to
blame for the animals' emaciated condition.</p>

<p>When a cold spell followed the thaw, the Englishmen gaped at the
thermometer, which was dropping rapidly towards thirty below zero,
and retreated hastily into the warm bunkhouse, firmly convinced that
no creature living could survive such a temperature. The rapid change
from cold to warm and back to cold again is a peculiarity of the
Alberta climate, but the Englishmen had thought that the Chinook was
the first warmth of an early spring. The unexpectedly bitter weather
alarmed and appalled them; they spent the day shut up in the house,
piling huge logs into the great square wood stove, that spluttered and
sent off an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>enormous heat. They concocted toothsome dishes for their
entertainment, for, like most Englishmen, they were expert hands at
"batching" and camping, and knew how to cook. Their fare included such
game as venison, moose, mountain goat and sheep, to say nothing of
the small game, mallard duck, prairie chicken, partridge, grouse and
quail which abounded in the wild woods of Bar Q, and the Englishmen had
prudently "brought them down" while rounding up the cattle, not knowing
that the shooting had contributed considerably to the flight of the
terrified herd.</p>

<p>This game, expertly drawn to the ranch by horse sleds, was piled up
frozen in the immense storeroom adjoining the bunkhouse, where they
also found an ample supply of stores. It was certain that no matter how
long the siege of Arctic cold might last, the hands of the Bar Q would
survive starvation.</p>

<p>Shut in the bunkhouse, their days were by no means empty, for when not
engaged in cooking or feeding the wood stove, they wrote articles on
"ranching in the wild northwest," or indited epistles home to thrilled
relatives, who received from their letters a vague notion that their
dear boys were sojourning in polar regions. Sometimes they would
find in the letters from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> English friends, whose knowledge of
Canada was of the weirdest, warnings to be careful of the treacherous
Esquimaux, and reminders to call, when they found time, upon some
relative whose address was somewhere in their neighborhood, in Ontario
or Nova Scotia. The ignorance abroad of the immense extent of the
Canadian provinces was almost unbelievable. To all their folks at home
the young Englishmen took delight in concocting thrilling romances in
which they figured as big game hunters and fishermen, and through which
they moved heroically, followed by bands of noble red men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p>While Angella did her chores in the morning, Jake looked after Nettie's
laughing, fair-haired baby. The breed adored the child, and the hours
he spent playing with him were the happiest of his life. Angella had
built a small "yard" for the baby to play in safely while Jake, on his
hands and knees, would play "cat and dog" outside the railings, to the
baby's unbounded delight.</p>

<p>He had grown into a beautiful child, with his mother's fair skin and
blue eyes, and his blonde hair curled in tiny ringlets all over his
small, round head. He was the soul of good humor, and though not
robust, his health was rapidly improving.</p>

<p>Life had assumed a new meaning for the woman recluse and the change was
reflected in her expression. The defiant look was almost gone from the
bright eyes, the lips were no longer bitterly compressed; with a faint
color in her cheeks, and her soft gray hair curling about her face,
Angella Loring was almost <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>beautiful, as she held the baby close in her
arms, and murmured foolish endearments over it.</p>

<p>By the time she finished her milking and chores in the early morning,
the baby would be awake, and as soon as she came into the house, he
would set up a loud demand for bath and food. Before either Jake or
Angella breakfasted, he must first be cared for. Satisfied, rosy and
clean, he would then be put in his "yard," to tumble happily about
among his favorite "toys," the clothes pins and empty thread spools,
which he rolled around the yard in high glee, or sucked and chewed upon
with relish.</p>

<p>One morning in March Angella's chores took longer than usual. As hard
as she pumped, the water froze before it could fall from the spout, and
the barn was full of stock, which had come up from the frozen pastures
to the shelter of the sheds. There were twenty or thirty head waiting
hungrily for their share of the feed and water, which was generally
reserved for the special milking stock and weak stuff interned in
the barn. Angella worked hard and valiantly, driving back the greedy
steers, and rescuing a half frozen calf, which barely escaped death
under the scampering heels.</p>

<p>Upon examining the little creature, she saw that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> its life was to
be saved she would have to take it to some warmer place than the barn.
Throwing together a rough sled made out of a couple of boards, she
managed to shove it underneath the motionless animal, and pull the
litter with a lariat over the frozen ground to the house.</p>

<p>Jake did not answer her calls to open the door and she had to push it
open herself, letting in an icy gust of wind. She tugged and pulled at
the sled till it slid into the kitchen, and at last deposited the calf
in front of the roaring fire. Breathing heavily from the exertion and
holding her sides, she leaned against the table, and suddenly caught
sight of Jake lying face downward on the floor. Her first thought was
that it was an attack of his periodical convulsions, but a moment
later she saw the empty "yard" as well. Her senses reeled; it seemed
as though the whole room began to swim around her, as slowly her knees
gave way, and for the first time in her life Angella Loring fainted.
But it was only for a moment; she came back to consciousness almost at
once and crawled on her knees to where Jake, now moaning and moving
his head, still lay stretched upon the floor. His contorted face was
horribly bruised and deathly pale, and when he opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> his eyes the
blood ran out of them. She saw then that Jake had been struck down and
beaten.</p>

<p>"Him! Him!" gibbered the breed.</p>

<p>"Jake, what has happened? Where's the baby? Oh-h!"</p>

<p>"Bobby&mdash;all&mdash;a&mdash;gone. Him&mdash;the Bull take a baby! Him gone away."</p>

<p>Again the universe began to spin about her, but she refused to faint a
second time. Feeling her way to the door, Angella Loring went out again
into the bitter cold to the barn, where the mare with her new colt
whinnied as she slipped the stock saddle across its back. She trapped
the colt in an adjoining stall, and then as she got on the mare's back,
she whispered:</p>

<p>"Go quickly, Daisy, or you'll not get back to your baby soon."</p>

<p>There was a long snorting whinny from Daisy&mdash;a cry of protest at being
taken from her colt&mdash;indignantly answered by the little one.</p>

<p>The nearest telephone was five miles from Angella's ranch, and when
she rode into the farm yard, in spite of the intense cold, the mare
was sweating from her wild race across the country. The astonished
farmer who led Angella to the 'phone&mdash;it was the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> she had
been known to step inside any of their houses&mdash;stayed by the door and
listened with pricked-up ears as the excited woman called Dr. McDermott
at Springbank. By a merciful chance he was there, and a few moments
later the farmer was helping his strange visitor to a seat, and calling
loudly to his wife for help. For again Angella Loring had fainted. Her
first question when she opened her eyes and looked up at her neighbors'
faces was:</p>

<p>"Has he come? Has Dr. McDermott come?"</p>

<p>And when they replied that he had not, she wrung her hands and broke
into weak tears.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p>The unexpected return of the "Governor," as the Englishmen had named
Bull Langdon, was an exciting event in their hitherto pleasant lives.
He arrived late on a March afternoon, the snort of his engine and the
honk of his horn arousing the "hands" from a siesta, where, stretched
before a raging wood fire, they drowsily smoked and read.</p>

<p>They dressed leisurely in warm fur coats and overshoes, before
answering his impatient summons, and sauntering out in their own good
time, smiled good-humoredly at the shouting cowman.</p>

<p>"Here, you! Take this in. Ain't no fire to the house. Want it thawed
out."</p>

<p>The first of the Englishmen, whose long name need not appear here&mdash;"Bo"
is what Bull Langdon called him&mdash;took the bundle in his hands and then
almost dropped it, for something moved inside it, and a sound that was
like a suffocated moan arose from its mysterious depths.</p>

<p>"My word! The thing's alive, d'you know," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>exclaimed the startled
Englishman. "Hang it all, man, I believe it's a baby."</p>

<p>"Take it to the bunkhouse," roared the Bull, backing into the garage.
"Thaw it out."</p>

<p>Gingerly carried into the bunkhouse by the amazed "Bo" and deposited
upon the cot that he himself had but recently reposed upon, the baby
continued its low, moaning cries. Both the little bare feet had kicked
out from the sheepskin coat, and were frozen stiff. One minute fist
stuck out of the coat, and there was a great swelling on the forehead,
where he had fallen off the seat of the car to the floor. Its whole
body, in fact, was bruised from the cruel bumping of that long mad ride
from Yankee Valley, a distance of thirty-five miles.</p>

<p>"Cutie," the name sneeringly imposed upon the other Englishman by Bull
Langdon, because of his natty dress and his monocle, now stuck that
despised piece of glass in his right eye, and surveyed the child with
amazement. Its cries were growing fainter, and a kind of frozen rigor
was creeping over it.</p>

<p>"Well, what're you gapin' at?" Bull Langdon was glowering in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Where in the world did you pick the little beggar up?" inquired "Bo."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"It ain't none o' your business," was the surly retort. "He's here, and
he's here to stay. He's mine, and he's got my brand on him."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that you brand babies in this country! Never
heard of such a thing! It's damned inhuman, I should say."</p>

<p>"Don't matter what you say or think. I want that kid thawed out. Give
'im something to eat. He's cold and hungry, but he's healthy young
stuff and 'll pull through. Kids ain't no different to cattle. Feed 'em
and keep 'em warm. That's all they need. He's bawlin' now for feed. You
got something handy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a bite of cold venison. Hardly the stuff for a baby."</p>

<p>"He ain't no baby. He's a yearling. Here!"</p>

<p>He had torn a strip of the venison from the piece, and had thrust it
into the child's hand. The tiny fingers closed feebly about the meat
and then feebly unclosed. The bright eyes, so like his mother's, opened
in one wide, blind stare, then the white lids came down over them,
closing the light out forever.</p>

<p>"Gone to sleep," grunted the cowman. "Keep the fire goin'. Thaw him
out and feed him. That's the stuff. He'll come round. He's good stuff.
I'm off for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> the timber. Be back soon. You ain't much good neither of
you at tendin' to cattle. So I'll give you a nurse maid's job. Let the
cattle rustle for themselves. You concentrate on&mdash;". He indicated with
a jerk of his thumb Nettie's child, now quite still where it lay.</p>

<p>Alone, the two Englishmen continued to look at each other, astonished
out of speech.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm hanged," said "Bo" at last, "absolutely hanged. What's to
do?"</p>

<p>"Carn't say any more than you can. Blessed if I know the first thing
about a baby."</p>

<p>"Cutie" was looking down sentimentally now at the small blonde head.</p>

<p>"It's awfully quiet, isn't it? Doesn't seem&mdash;" He touched the tiny
hand. It was cold as ice, and all of a sudden the two men looking down
on that little frozen thing realized the truth.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" whispered the one. "The little beggar's dead, d'you know."</p>

<p>Their eyes met apprehensively.</p>

<p>"What's to do?"</p>

<p>"Gad, I wish I knew."</p>

<p>"It's a dashed serious matter."</p>

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll plug over to the house and telephone. Where'd he say he was
going?&mdash;er to timber something. I wonder what his telephone number
might be."</p>

<p>"Try Information. She should know."</p>

<p>But Information knew of no timber number, but when the stuttering
Englishman made clear to her that there was a dead baby at Bar Q, she
connected him swiftly with the Provincial Police Station at Cochrane,
and a voice at that end promised after a series of impatient questions
to "look into it," and "Bo" hung up.</p>

<p>The charm of "rawnching" was over for the Englishmen. All the rest of
that afternoon they sat in somber silence in the bunkhouse, carefully
averting their eyes from the small covered head. They had no heart for
their usual evening meal, but contented themselves with strong tea and
smoking steadily upon their pipes.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when the sound of a motor along the road was heard,
and then the labored panting of the engine as it made the steep grade
to the ranch. The two young men hoped the police had come, not knowing
that the solitary mounty who had been despatched upon the case was
coming by horse twenty-eight miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> from the ranch, and could not
arrive for several hours. When the Englishmen opened the door of the
bunkhouse, they were surprised to see a woman running swiftly ahead of
the fur-coated doctor, whose acquaintance they had already made.</p>

<p>Their first thought was that Angella was the mother, and indeed she
might well have been as she threw herself down beside Nettie's baby,
and burst into uncontrolled, despairing sobs over the little dead body.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p>Chum Lee packed everything he possessed in the world in his capacious
bamboo bag, slipping in between the articles of clothing bottles and
pipes and boxes filled with redolent odors. He muttered and chattered
frantically to himself as he packed, and his hands shook as if with
ague. He tied and knotted a stout rope about the bag and, trembling and
shivering, put on his old sheepskin coat, muskrat cap and fur mittens.
Hoisting the bag upon his back, Chum Lee hastened on panic-winged feet
away from the camp at Barstairs.</p>

<p>He had awakened from a long doze, in which he dreamed of summer seas,
green as jade, of colorful sampans, alive with moving, friendly faces;
of a girl's face, oval and soft, with gentle almond eyes, and a smile
like a caress, whose hair was black and smooth as the wing of a teal,
and decked with bridal flowers. That fair vision of his home and the
young wife he had left in China vanished into the cruel mists of
memory. He awoke to intense cold, the bleakness of death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> itself in
the one-room bunkhouse. With a sob, the Chinaman crept out of bed,
scurried across the room, only to find the fire was out, then staggered
to the woodbox. On his way back to the stove, his arms loaded, he
stumbled across something that lay upon the floor in his path. A loud
cry escaped the Chinaman. The wood dropped from his shivering arms and
clattered down upon the Bar Q "hand." Batt Leeson lay upon his back,
where he had rolled out of his bunk overnight. His mouth and eyes were
wide open, but did not move or flicker, for Batt was in his last long
sleep.</p>

<p>The sight of the dead man, the last of the "boys" to succumb to the
"black plague," was too much for the overwrought and drug-weakened
Chinaman. Even the terrors of the zero weather were less appalling to
face than what was inside that shack. Between his chattering teeth,
Chum Lee sent up frantic appeals to the gods of his ancestors to lift
the dreaded curse which had befallen the land in which he had sojourned
too long.</p>

<p>As he went out of the gate, the long-drawn savage roar of hungry bulls
followed him and, turning back upon a sudden resolution, Chum Lee
shoved the bars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> along the sliding doors. He would perform a last act
of charity and win the favor of the gods. The famished brutes within
would come up presently against the loosened door, and find themselves
free from the prison where they had been confined for days.</p>

<p>That day, bellowing and moaning their unceasing demands for feed
and water, the bulls crashed against the doors, as the Chinaman had
foreseen, and they gave. The animals crossed a barrier of logs, and
with heads lifted, they sniffed along the corrals and found the bars
which the Chinaman had left down, and strayed out into the lower
pasture. The gate stood wide open to the highway, and the vast country
stretched beyond, unspeakably desolate under its mantle of deep snow.
Out into the world, in search of that which had been denied them in
their luxurious and costly sheds, went the famous Hereford bulls.</p>

<p>Pampered and petted, used to being fed almost by hand, and knowing no
range save the sweet home pastures, how were they likely to fare in the
wilderness? Now the merciless cold of the implacable winter smote them
to the bone, and the unbroken expanse of frozen snow rose four feet
deep in mounds and hillocks on all sides of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>There were no nibblings. Streams and rivers were frozen hard. The
wretched cattle swept along the road huddled together before a blinding
wind out of the hill country, forerunner of a coming Chinook, but with
its first blast intensifying the cold and lashing the last ounce of
strength out of the lost and famished cattle.</p>

<p>They drifted blindly before the wind, driven against fence lines
and trapped in coulee and gulch. Great white flakes began to fall
like fairy birds drifting in the dazzling sunlight; like millions of
feathers they fell upon the huddled herd, burying them under a mighty
mound.</p>

<p>The only survivor of all that noble herd was the bull once known
as "Prince Perfection Bar Q the IV," of whom the great specialist
had predicted that he would startle the purebred world. Facing the
west wind like a gladiator, the Prince turned from his fellows, and
defiantly trod his way through the storm to where the outline of
the hill country loomed up with its promise of shelter and food.
Sniffing along the road allowances, pausing only to bellow his immense
complaint, the massive brute pressed on his way.</p>

<p>There was a celebration at Bow Claire. Lanterns hung from rafters and
eaves to give the place an air of festivity. Across the back of the big
lumber camp, where the fifty-five men who had pulled through were now
convalescent, bunting and bright Indian blankets were hung.</p>

<p>Now that the last of the men had been pronounced out of danger, the
lumber-jacks, with the connivance of the doctor and an Indian, had
smuggled into the camp the provisions for the intended festival.</p>

<p>When Nettie came from the foreman's house that evening, to make her
nightly rounds of her emergency camp hospital, the surprise party
awaiting her almost frightened her. A dozen accordions all struck up
at the same moment; mouth organs joined in; Jim Crow, the only darky
in the camp, grinning from ear to ear, was twanging a real banjo, and
Mutt, a giant Russian, with a voice like a great bell, led all hands
in a deafening cheer for Nettie, a cheer that, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> of their
weakness, the men kept up for a long time.</p>

<p>Astonished and moved beyond speech, Nettie looked at her "boys," and
smiled her thanks, though the tears ran down her cheeks. But the
ceremonies were by no means over with the cheering and singing. Thin
and pale, his eyes dark with a look of tragedy that wrung the girl's
heart, Cyril Stanley stepped forward, a bouquet of flowers in his hands.</p>

<p>He alone in all the camp had been unable to find the courage to speak
to Nettie. Those flowers, ragged from their journey on horseback,
had cost the Bow Claire Camp more than the bouquet of a prima donna;
and were intended to speak a message to the girl that the men lacked
eloquence to say. Cyril had begged for the privilege of being the one
to present the flowers. He came slowly forward, daring to look Nettie
steadily in the face for the first time, and put out the hand that held
the flowers; but the words he had planned to speak died on his lips. He
could not even whisper her name.</p>

<p>She took the flowers from him and looked deep into his eyes. While the
camp looked on in bewildered silence, the two estranged lovers gazed at
one another for a long moment and when it had passed it had taken with
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> all the doubt and misunderstanding that had clouded Cyril Stanley's
mind. Something within him seemed to burst, breaking down all the dikes
of hatred he had built up in bitterness against her. He knew, as he
looked into Nettie Day's clear eyes, that he loved her still beyond
anything else on earth, and that he could have sworn by the living God
above them that she could do, and had done, no wrong; that her heart
was clean and pure and unstained.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sharp sound broke upon the hush that had fallen so strangely
in the camp. The crisp metallic ring of a horse's hoofs sounded
outside, and slowly the girl, her flowers still in her arms, turned as
pale as death.</p>

<p>His chin thrust out, his big knotted hands swinging like a prize
fighter's, half drunk with alcohol and mad desire, Bull Langdon burst
into the camp. His glance swept that circle of feeble, motionless men,
then turned to transfix the unhappy girl, whose flowers now lay where
they had fallen to the floor. Before a word was said the truth flashed
like a miracle over Cyril Stanley's mind. Now Nettie Day would never
need to say one word in explanation to her lover. A flood of memories
rushed over the boy, shaking him to his depths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> as he realized the
damnable crime that had been wrought against the girl he loved, and
which death alone could now wipe out.</p>

<p>"So here y'are," cried the cattleman, towering above the cowering
Nettie. "You come along home with me, gell. Your baby&mdash;and <i>mine</i>,
gell, is at Bar Q. He's needin' you more'n this bunch of bos."</p>

<p>An inarticulate cry broke from Cyril's throat as he leaped fairly into
the face of Bull Langdon. Staggered by the unexpected onslaught, and
then seeing who it was that had attacked him, his lips drawn back like
a gorilla's, Bull Langdon, with a sweep of his arm, felled the boy to
the ground. He tried vainly to rise, but, weakened by his recent long
illness, he had hardly struggled to his knees before the cattleman sent
him spinning to the floor again.</p>

<p>A low murmuring passed over the crowd of lumbermen, a hoarse cursing
protest, that grew in volume and fury as the Bull laid his hand on
Nettie Day. It burst like a tidal wave when the frenzied girl broke
from his grasp and fled through the open door.</p>

<p>The Bull found himself surrounded by a mob of mad men, cursing and
weeping because of their weakness and inability to pull down the man
they longed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> kill, they leaped and struck at him. With his back to
the wall he struck out right and left with his mighty fists, sending
one man after another staggering to the floor, meanwhile edging
craftily nearer and nearer to the door through which Nettie Day had
fled.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p>It was a still, cold night. Nettie Day rushed blindly on horseback
through the pathless dead timber lands. With amazing presence of mind
she had mounted the Bull's own mare, which he had left standing outside
the camp. On and on she urged the great animal, heedless of snow-laden
brush and boughs that snapped back and lashed her as she rode.</p>

<p>The dense woods lay wrapped in a vast silence. Not a twig stirred on
the frost-bowed trees. No living foot seemed to move within the depths
of the forest. All that she heard, if indeed she heard anything, as
she fled like the wind through the timber land, was the crunch of
her horse's hoofs on the frozen snow. On and on, indifferent to the
piercing cold; intent on one purpose only, to reach Bar Q and get her
baby before the Bull could overtake her.</p>

<p>The mare was built on big, slim lines. Of thoroughbred racing stock by
her sire, she was the foal of a Percheron mare, and therefore swift as
well as strong. She carried the girl throughout that night without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
once stopping, all of the twenty miles to the Bar Q.</p>

<p>Dawn was breaking over the still sleeping land, and a great shadowy
arch spread like a rainbow across the sky, the long-prayed-for symbol
of Chinook weather. Before the day was half gone a wind would blow like
a bugle call from the mountains, and, racing with the sun, would send
its warm breath over the land. But Nettie Day was blind to the omen of
spring. Cramped and cold from her long ride, with a speechless terror
tearing at her heartstrings, she fell rather than dismounted from her
horse, and staggered toward the house, at the door of which Angella
Loring stood, with empty arms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another kind of drama had taken place in the timber land.
Bloody and battered from his fight with the lumber-jacks and loggers,
Bull Langdon sought the trail. In those deep woods, so still and
silent, with the spell of the night upon them, in spite of the deep
silence, there was a feeling of live, wild things hidden in bush and
coolie, crouching and peering through the snow-laden brush.</p>

<p>He knew the country well, and had almost as keen a sense of smell as
the cattle themselves. He had boasted that he could "sniff his way"
anywhere through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> the foothill country, and that his long years of
night riding had given him a cat's eyes. Where the dense forests broke
here and there, the clearings were as bright as day in the moonlight.</p>

<p>It was twelve miles to Morley, an Indian trading post on the edge of
the Stony Indian Reserve, and the Bull calculated that by turning off
the main trail and following an old cattle path, he could cut the
distance down a third.</p>

<p>The white moon behind moving clouds lighted his way one moment and
plunged him in darkness the next. The cattle trail went in a wavering
line toward a valley that ran along the Ghost River, where lay the
summer range of the foothill cattle.</p>

<p>If the woods were still and dark, the valley, flooded with moonlight,
looked like a great pool on whose farther bank dark forms were vaguely
moving. These were the stray cattle that had escaped the fall round-up,
and found shelter from the inclement weather in the seclusion of this
deep valley, protected by the hills on one side, and the rapidly
flowing Ghost on the other.</p>

<p>The first impulse of a cattleman upon spotting stray cattle on the
range is to ride close enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> them to read the brand upon their
ribs; no easy matter at night, but the Bull was used to this. He was
halfway across the valley when a certain restless stirring made him
aware that he had been seen. Range cattle will move blindly before a
man on a horse, but it is a reckless man who will risk himself near
range cattle afoot. The roar of one of the leaders sent the cowman
cautiously back into the shelter of the brush. He was unprepared to
meet a stampede, but he marked the place to which the cattle had
strayed, and made a mental note to round them up in a few days.</p>

<p>He was now but four miles from Morley, still traveling along the edges
of the woods, when suddenly a low moaning call, growing ever in volume
and power, until it swelled into a mighty roar that shook the bristling
branches of the trees, smote the still night, and reverberated in the
surrounding hills.</p>

<p>The cattleman stood stock-still, his head lifted and his face strained
upward, his ears alert to catch the sound again. For he well knew that
great far-reaching bellow which had once swelled his breast with pride;
it was the furious challenge of the champion bull. Somewhere, close at
hand, but hidden in those dense woods, Prince Perfection Bar Q the IV
was at large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>The sound was not repeated and Bull Langdon came at last out of the
sheltering woods. A wide field that flanked on one side the Banff
Highway lay before him, on the other side of which were the fenced
lands of the Indian Reserve.</p>

<p>As he moved through the thick woods, pausing every now and then to
listen for treading hoofs behind him or for a breath of that low,
menacing murmur that preceded the terrible roar, the cattleman's
overwrought fancy had pictured the bull upon his trail, nor was it
premonition that held him, but the fearful certainty that the savage
animal was following close upon his tracks.</p>

<p>Bull Langdon considered the open space of the field and reckoned up his
chances of making a swift dash across to the road, and across the road
to the line of Indian fencing. A certain safety from his pursuer. For
an instant he hesitated, then with lowered head, like one of his own
blindly driven cattle, the cowman sped across the field. Not, however,
swiftly enough for the Hereford bull that had trailed him.</p>

<p>On the edge of the timber land, Prince Perfection Bar Q the IV stood
in a proud and questioning attitude with his stern eyes fixed upon the
moving speck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> before him. Slowly he marked his prey, then his head
dropped, and with a lumbering gait, yet incredibly swift, he made
straight for his quarry. The cowman, his back to the oncoming bull,
intent only on reaching the shelter of the barbed wire fences on the
south side of the Banff Highway before it was too late, did not dare
look round, as like a missile released from a colossal catapult the
great bull shot across the field. Sideways and still on the run, with
his lowered head swinging from side to side, he drove his horns clear
through the cowman's ribs. There was a horrible rending sound, and
suddenly Bull Langdon was tossed into the air to fall to earth like a
stone. Again and again the savage bull gored and tossed him until he
was rent into pieces.</p>

<p>A master vengeance was in that act of justice, though no torture of
Bull Langdon's body could atone for the torture he had inflicted upon
Nettie Day's soul.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<p>"Hear me, lass," said Dr. McDermott, his hands resting upon the bent
shoulders of Angella Loring. "In the old land, I was a stable lad
and you the grand young lady of the manor house; my father was your
father's groom, and all the McDermotts before me served the Lorings;
but here in Alberta we're naught but mon and woman, and as mon to
woman, lass, I'm asking you to be my wife."</p>

<p>She answered without words, laying her hands in his, but as he looked
into her eyes, the doctor saw all the shadows of the sad years fade
away like ghosts before the dawn, and love like the sunlight of the
land of their adoption had taken their place.</p>

<p>"It's a puir rough sort of man you're getting," said the doctor
huskily, but she laid her hands upon his lips and answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dr. McDermott, I'll be getting the salt of the earth!"</p>

<p>Hat twisting in his hands, outside the barn Cyril waited for Nettie.
As she came out, a pail of milk in either hand, he gently took them
from her and set them upon the ground. He had learned that speech by
heart&mdash;the speech he was going to say to Nettie, but now as they looked
into one another's eyes, no words were needed. As instinctively as life
itself, they moved to each other. Nothing on earth now mattered save
that they were in each other's arms.</p>

<p class="space-above">In the house, hand in hand, they faced their friends, and immersed
in their own joy noted not that the doctor's arm was about Angela's
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Nettie and I are going to get married in the summer," said Cyril
simply.</p>

<p>"Why wait for the summer?" rumbled their doctor friend. "Angel and I
are going to Calgary tonight. Come with us."</p>

<p>"'Twill take a month or two to rebuild the home again," said Cyril
wistfully.</p>

<p>"Why build again," said Angella, softly. "There's <i>this</i> house for you,
Cyril. It's our wedding gift to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> and Nettie. I'll be going&mdash;" She
smiled and blushed like a girl, but finished the words bravely&mdash;"to my
husband's house," she said.</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
